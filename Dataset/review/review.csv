"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      If u want to go to a disciplined college and want to indulge in some serious studies with great expertise teachers, then this is the college you are looking for.Overall great college for placement and industry exposure.The only issue with some students could be a less of timepass and attendance is of great concern here   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      I completed my final year in Electronics Engineering from DMCE this year. This college is good in terms of infrastructure and other facilities. All faculties are good, well qualified, supportive and helpful at any hour of  time.Along with academics, our college also provides opportunities to the students to manifest their technical skills and talents through various events such as Tech Fests, Inter-collegiate and National level Project Competitions and also International Conference of Paper Publications and also cultural gatherings where students display their hidden talents in sports, dance, music, etc.Many IT companies and few core companies do come for placements. Extra seminars and training programmes for an industrial exposure, is also arranged at times for students.Overall, it was a very good experience being a student of this college.   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      Hi friends, I am studying in this college and one thing which makes my college to be one of the good colleges of Maharashtra is that exposure to industrial sector. My college has good faculties where they are updating us with the current technologies but exposure to Industrial sector is poor that is we are not able to much understand the need of electrical engineering in the field of the industrial sector. And we know that the more we are experienced the more perfect skills and knowledge do we possess. Other than that everthing in my college is amazing with the student crowd to the faculties. The only thing of my college has to be improved is that exposure to industrial sector.   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      Our college is best known to do enjoyment. Enjoyment refers to have parties, play football in the ground, and have camps and many more things too. Normal studies of the engineering takes place normally of 4 to 5 hours seriously. Other time we enjoy our life thoroughly whether it is in the college or outside the college or in the home. I do not have any peculiar aim or ardent passionate desire to achieve it, only thing is that I want to live the simple and pleasant life with an average income and enjoy my life happily.   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",      Good college with great placement.it has no ground for sports.canteen is not up to the mark.crowd is good and comfortable to be with.faculty is okay and helpful.the college provides a good amount of facilities.industrial visit is there every year.campus is okay   
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      The college has got a new building but it should have WiFi service available.Guest Lectures of industry experts must be more frequent.College placements were controlled by a single faculty member and not all students got placed. This can be improved by including a student body solely responsible for placements along-side the faculty.   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      I got admission in 2011, it is the good college.It's has got a library which is big enough. Infrastructure is good . still, an old stepped classroom was much good. College got a gym which is always close. The teaching staff is good, a nontechnical staff is little bad. Labs are dedicated. But  needs to upgrade. Software labs are good.  Fees are high enough. In 2011was was an 82000per year. Fees are higher than others   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      The main advantage is the location of this college.Very close to thane.Infrastructure, placements, and the crowd are also very good.The faculty is average but you can manage your academics.Most of the time you enjoy your college life on grounds only.Affordable fees.   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      The infrastructure of the college was good.It could have been better as at my time in 2014 construction of the new building was in progress.Students should be encouraged to participate in opting external projects, guest lectures should be organised,summer internship program should be conducted. College life was awesome apart from mandatory attendance part. Placements of the college were good, college should try to inculcate more work environment into the college.College faculty was good but again could have been better in terms of using different teaching method rather than following conventional one.Fees of the college were economical.overall college's ambience was good.   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      College infrastructure is the only thing which deserves 4 stars. Not at all good placements. Expensive fees. Worst internal marking. No technical fest from last year onwords. Sports and cultural days are conducted together. Gym is only for seeing and not open for students. Non teaching faculty is very poor. Most importantly, Too much fees and no good placements.   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE) is located quite conveniently close to Airoli railway station on the trans-harbour route. The campus is just about 5-6 minutes away from the railway station and it's not a very bad walk either.This is where Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE) takes a hitting somewhat. As of now, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really have anything like a Ã¢â‚¬ËœcampusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a building. This is why some students go all the way to Airoli. The placements, in general, are pretty good, with companies like Infosys and Patni taking students in big numbers. The Civil Engineering department has an excellent placement record of 100%. Chemical and Mechanical Engineering departments have below average placements. Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE) faces a problem very similar to most colleges located in village-like areas- village crowd. About 40% of the crowd comes from villages. Most students say itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better than the general Airoli crowd Datta Meghe College of Engineering host their cultural fest Milestone in the months of Jan or Feb, and the technical fest (having the original name Technitude) in the month of March.   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      In our college, some faculty members are experienced while most of them are freshers. The college has an average teaching staff, canteen service is poor, and mobiles are banned on the campus. Classrooms are good, still sometimes, there is a ventilation problem & sometimes ceiling fans fall in the classrooms.   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      It's very good college if staff and results are considered!Even though the campus is not a point to discuss on but surely the massive 13-floor building structure is influence. The campus selection seems average and deserving students find their career indeed!   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      College life sucks, placements are good, an old faculty is good but new one sucks, the best canteen in the world, Of course, I am speaking sarcastically. management doesn't care about it, Recently started college days but not up to the mark, I would never refer anyone this college.   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",      Teaching here is good. But space provided isn't sufficient.  No playground no proper common room.  Teachers are cooperative I would recommend this college for people only for courses like civil engineering. This college is basically known for civil engineering.    InfrastructureAcademicsCampus Lif
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      Stupid Crowd. Never go to this College if You are going for Crowd. But overall good faculty.The problem is Management quota where they ask a huge amount of money and give admission to students who are not deserving. Plus No Campus. The Labs are not good.    "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      You can't say that this is a bad College. This College provides you good faculty but still it doesn't provide the students the whole package. I mean there's no campus in the college. I guess it is the main drawback that when you enter in the college you just see a building. Except this thing, you can really enjoy. I mean I m enjoying it. If u have got even a little friends you can make really good memories.   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      The college is easily accessible. A 5 min walk from Airoli station. Railway commuters would find it manageable. There is hardly  any campus area but the infrastructure is good enough according to my limited experience of various engineering colleges.The best part about the college is having a nice blend of both young and experienced faculty which is probably among the most important features.I would not recommend this college if you have a profound interest in sports. There is no such thing as a playground in our campus. When it comes to placement and training the college does a good job and civil department of the college is well known for producing top university rankers for years now.The college does not have a hostel either so accommodation could be an issue.Technical fest, cultural fest 'Milestone', Sportszilla are some of the events that take place and are enjoyable, to say the least.The college locality isn't exactly a great place to hangout.  With the cheerful crowd that you will meet here, you are bound to make some friends for life.It's definitely a great college considering the cutoff criteria of other good colleges like space and VJTI.I definitely would recommend DMCE to all my friends.   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",      Thew Life in this college is bit boring. No place near the college where you can chill out. The College staff not so friendly. Average teaching experience teachers. No campus where you can roam. A Great infrastructure and for students addicted to outside food will love this college especially the non-vegetarians. The College very much near from Airoli station. Placements are quite not good. very few well-reputed companies visit the college. Overall I'll say an average College. Not a 3rd class one but not the 1st class one also.   
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      Our college is sufficient & better than few other Engineering colleges.There's still a Room for improvement just like every place in our Country.It is a good college, nice crowd & good teachers.Placements for IT & Computer are Good as far as I know & even other Branches get placed in IT.Overall a Good College. :)   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",      If placement and faculty are your concern then Datta Meghe is a decent place for both. The crowd is mixed involving both the smart and the dull(thanks to reservation system). The library and laboratories have some outdated books and instruments respectively but so is our syllabus. Overall Datta Meghe is not at all a bad place to me.   
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      Chemical and Mechanical Engineering departments have below average placements, though. The Chemical department, in particular, has really underwhelming placements. Overall placements are about 50%. Major companies visiting campus: Infosys, L&T infotech, Wipro, IBM, TCS   "

"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      the new building has been constructed and it is probably one of the best infra in Mumbai engineering colleges. This college is the next best college for CIVIL after the autonomous institutes. the Fests do lack the frills, but are descent enough. Make an informed choice.   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      I guess I can describe the college a little better now after studying here for like 2 months, after Banerjee has taken over; they're trying to be the NEXT Father Angel's. Majority of the crowd is not worth the description, but there are some really good students too! the seniors simply rock!! A few teachers are a little Bad, while some can't teach at all!   "

"
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      Attendance matters only when you've a female professor and when you're in F.E. otherwise very much helpful. Canteen was worst but our fee hike has made new canteen for new students. No parking space. No playgrounds. Only place to hang around is Hotel Priyanka and Mamta (most of you come to know once you take admission). If somehow you go to college for inquiry or admission reason, boys, please look for a professor in Comps department.. She is Awesome!! :)   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      Festivals and tech fest are pretty much fun(You should be involved though)Placements are up to the mark provided you qualify.In short its a good coll., for sure you will have fun, make the greatest friends, as you embark on the mammoth journey of Engg.All the best!

"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      The placements in general are pretty good, with companies like Infosys and Patni taking students in big numbers. The Civil Engineering department has an excellent placement record of 100%. Not a bad college, not bad placements, but if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going for the crowd, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go to DMCE.   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      DMCE is a great college. Absolutely LAX in EVERYTHING! Faculty is extremely co-operative (exceptions prove the rule!)Very liniment as far as attendance and assignments are concerned. About the crowd, unless you are from one of those up-tight and inflexible dude from a high class family in South Mumbai who makes friends ONLY with equals, you should not have any problem here. All in all a very fun loving and pleasant crowd.Old building infrastructure and labs might not be very good ( IT labs are pathetic!) but the leniency in Attendance, assignments and TW marks more than make up for it.There are not very known hangouts in airoli but you can always go to Thane or Mulund or the not-so-far Vashi for doing tp !Canteen is now relocated to the basement of the new building but its still not THAT good !I would suggest you to come here if you are a laid back, and chilled out fellow. Pretty nice college !   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      There are three problems (3 C's) mentioned above:-1.Campus.2.Canteen.3.Crowd.The changes;-1.Campus- Yeah campus still remains an issue as there is only the building...but there are a couple of grounds just behind the college which can be used for cricket, football etc2.Canteen:- The canteen has changed completely..much wider and better..nothing to complain.3.Crowd:- Due to excellent placements in Civil and Comps dept. majority of the students are from Mumbai side!   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      Now, we can say it has become one of the ambitious college for students especially for those who lives near thane, or vashi because time taken to reach the college is very less compared to other colleges. The teaching staff is very honest, knowledgeable and positive by their attitude (especially experienced staff). Not only profs are supportive but also seniors.    "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",      good college from the academic point of view. some teachers are disappointing but most are very cooperative and approachable. class rooms are spacious and comfortable. the library is a real asset. ample books and just the right ambiance to read. crowd is fun loving and easy going. attendance is not very strict but better be safe with 70-75 %.   
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",      There are hangout places like CCD & Dominos a little far... but in Airoli only! And the college building is big enough... we have badminton court on 2nd floor & 1st floor is full library... canteen has improved a lot... no hazards in it... one of the best college for civil.. if you get 110-140 then you will surely get this college depending on branch!   
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      Nice college. Good placement, good library, good staff and supportive seniors... the new building is excellent its campus is bigger in terms of floors rather than acres... it is the tallest engineering college in Mumbai. No restrictions here in Datta Meghe... very good college...Enjoy your life :p   "

"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      ""Dmce has good faculty but poor canteen and sports facility. The tech fest of the college is awesome with exciting prices to be won""   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","      ""The biggest disappointment is the college location as it is in the middle of nowhere in a place called 'Airoli'. The college reputation however makes up for the location as it is arguably the best college in navi Mumbai .The faculty is average to say the least,its top notch for civil engineering and abysmal for electrical engineering.The placement are a saving grace though and the % of graduates placed in campus interview is growing every year.""   "
"Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","       If your aim is to just focus on studies and want to do masters soon after B.E. then this college will suit you. If you are looking for placements soon after your engineering then pls don't go.The placements are not good at all. Only IT students get placed for a salary range of 2 lakhs to 3.2 lakhs. If you are from etrx,chemical or mech then its too difficult to find job as only IT companies visit. The infrastructure is good if you are not an athletic person. The teaching staff is very good. The HOD and teachers are really helpful."
"KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Mumbai","    Decent college wasn't talked about much when i joined, i was kinda hesitant on joining.The crowd is decent mostly Gujjus ,seniors help out a lot i learnt website making and Photoshop from my seniors.Some Teachers are really good and helpful and those are the new young teachers who have been students before and know what students have to go through, some teachers are you're regular teacher type, don't have to spell it out now do i? Infrastructure has been improving since i joined. The student committees are the heart of the college who bring out the change thats needed if you're there don't hesitate to join one."
"KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Mumbai",    Infrastructure is good. Very few students gets placed. Faculty doesn't have great knowledge about the subjects. Hostel facility is available only for out station students. Hardly any practical exposure is available. Low level of industry exposure. Overall just an average college
"KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Mumbai",    Only a few really good professors. They just run after us for attendance (in spite of such bad teaching). Internal marks are also given on basis of attendance. We just have to run after profs during submissions. Placements are good as we can get placed at vidyavihar.
"KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Mumbai","    Since it's college life, so it was great because of bunking,gathering in the canteen, fests, and the rest obvious fun. But there is no good college campus to hang out, not good premises (like ideal college imagination). The faculty is average like any other college. Campus Recruitment should be improvised. More and better companies should be called for hiring."
"KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Mumbai","    College life is good.. infrastructure has improved a lot since my pass out. Placement is also good, needs to bring more core companies especially for electronics and telecom branch.. faculty can also improve. Need to bring some more qualified, more skilled and people with good communication to improve the quality of education and academics"
"KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Mumbai","    At first the college infrastructure looks simple and college looks simple too but we all know that we should not judge a book by its cover. There is a very warm vibe that comes when you enter the college , every person in the college (faculty, HODs, students etc) all creates a positive aura which helps to enhance the overall learning of one mind and soul. All the teachers and seniors are well mannered and very helpful"
"KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Mumbai","    K. J. Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Sion opens a plethora of opportunities to grab on to and gain knowledge and experience before entering the practical world. I am a student of Second Year Information Technology Engineering. Department of Information Technology majorly focuses on innovation and student projects. There is an Institution Innovation Council (IIC) under MHRDs Innovation Cell that promotes innovation. Several expert lectures on state-of-the-art technologies, workshops, etc. are organized in the department that help you keep updated with the cutting edge inventions in IT. Students are given ample opportunities to strengthen their skills in areas of their interest. I have been grateful to the department for having shown the faith and confidence in me and allowing to explore new horizons while participating in different competitions. The head of IT department and all faculties of IT Department are very helpful and promote the spread of knowledge to every student here. Their college has several committees, societies, and associations on campus, encouraging students to participate in different activities. There are two main festivals in the college, first is Surge the cultural festival and second is Renaissance which is a Tech festival. Several opportunities for the scholarship are available. Assignments and Projects form an important part of the daily routine here and are not simply writing long. Assignments include innovative developments and help you learn a lot. Each student is encouraged by the respective faculty to work on good projects, make timely submission of assignments and provide appropriate output. Any difficulty faced is addressed by the faculties instantly. The results are very good and placements are also good enough for the deserving. I believe the college truly focuses on student growth and has a vision to provide excellent performers to the industry."
"KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Mumbai","    The college has a vast campus and has clean and peaceful surroundings. I am a student of IT department and I must say that it provides best education to the students. The department helps in the overall development of the students.There are various technical committees and student bodies in the college which help the students to improve their skills. The infrastructure of college is well developed. Specifically, the IT Department has a new infrastructure, a building named Riturang with all new labs and very pleasant place to study. The college also conducts technical and culture fest every year. College also focuses on the extra curricular activities. There is a football turf, open gymnasium,canteen,library, computer labs and various other labs dedicated to each field.The faculties of IT Department are also very helpful towards the students. In short, the college helps in the complete growth of a student."
"KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Mumbai","    Infrastructure: The infrastructure of our college is excellent with 24 hours of wifi in the institute areas. There are well-equipped classrooms with projectors and a library having a wide range of books ranging from references, novels, competitive exams and many more. Faculty: Our faculty members are good enough. They have prompt knowledge and appropriate qualifications to teach their subjects. Also, they have vivid knowledge of other subjects as well. But some of the teachers are very adamant and aggressive. So students can't talk to them comfortably. The student to faculty ratio is very good. The lab assistants are also quite good. Other: The college has good tie-ups with the industry. Regular industrial visits are also organized here. The sports fest named Score and cultural fest named Surge is great. There is also a technical fest named Renaissance. The campus crowd is good. Scholarships are also provided to academically weaker students as well as toppers. Placements : Placements in our college were very good because our placement team trained us right before placements which greatly helped us in facing interviews."
"KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Mumbai","    K.J. Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology is located in Sion, a neighborhood of Mumbai. From a student’s point of view, factors such as college location, traveling distance plays an important role in the overall educational activity. KJSIEIT College is nearer to the central railway station and also surrounded by abundant bus stops near the college vicinity. It is also very well connected to the highways. So, one can travel with private/government vehicles. This not only makes traveling easy for the students but also helps them to perform day-to-day activities without stress and time loss. The infrastructure of our college has various facilities like state of the art computer labs, a diversified library with books containing the knowledge of various fields. Emphasis is also given for the development of innovative ideas amongst the students. This is achieved by a good initiative taken by the college in the form of an incubation center viz. Riiddl Lab where meticulously the faculty nurtures the thoughts among the students by constant interaction and group discussion. The faculty members are not only experienced but also very kind and friendly. They help the students in solving academic problems whenever needed. The faculty understands that in addition to technical skills, extra-curricular activities also play an important role in order to develop skills like leadership, management, organizing, communication, etc. So, the faculty also supports and encourages us to participate in sports and extracurricular activities with the help of which students get to develop mental as well as physical state. They have many technical committees and clubs for students to join of their interest some of them are IEEE , IET , IETE, IEI , CSI , ACS , ROBOCON , INFINITE LOOP, etc. KJSIEIT provides various opportunities to grow by conducting various guest lectures and seminars on modern technology.KJSIEIT conducts technical as well as cultural fest every year so that the balance between entertainment and study remains constant. After even semester college conducts and official industrial visit in which students gain practical knowledge of the things they have been studying which is very helpful to them in future."
"KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Mumbai","    KJSIEIT has a huge campus with 2 buildings, 2 big grounds, 1 park, and an astroturf. The Institute is accredited with grade ’A’ by NAAC and also three programs namely Computer engineering, Electronics Engineering, and Electronics & Telecommunication engineering are accredited by NBA. Apart from these three programs, Information Technology engineering is another good program offered by KJSIEIT.

Facilities for various indoor and outdoor sports are provided by the college."
"KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Mumbai","The college has a very big and hygienic campus. It has many activities within it like cultural forums, fest, Exhibitions, etc. It has a very playground where you showcase your sports activities. It also has a startup school which is RIIDL where you can present your unique ideas and get help for them. The college's fees too high than the average. The admission process is very simple, it's all online based that you have to just fill the form for a particular course and then just wait for the merit list to come.

"KJ Somaiya College of Engineering, Mumbai ","      College was very well in function before autonomous. After this ""autonomy"", headache is x1000 times. Trouble to everyone including staff. Although autonomous, fees are way higher than otherautonomous colleges. Somaiya is only for rich people now. Unnecessary and time wasting procedure for simple things. Improper management causing it all.  Regarding placement, 50% IT companies, 45% Marketing and remaining 5% inclued core and pizza marketing etc.company which has no logic for engineers. Why you giving your student marketing when you have done engineering? If some 12th passed reading this and are excited about somaiya life,i will simply say make sure your pocket is healthy all time. Yes rest things go well e.g.bunking,masti, copying  n all etc. But dont expect great things in return and you have to give your hard input if you want to make your career and if you are clever.   "

Also, the college has turned autonomous last year and looks pretty good to be one of the top engineering colleges in India.    "
"KJ Somaiya College of Engineering, Mumbai ","      My experience at KJSCE was undoubtedly the best phase of my life, considering the huge campus with n number of spots to while away your time, the people here and the way too much casual attitude of the college which really helped us to enjoy our college life! Coming to the   teaching part, the faculty needs to improve and also the pattern of teaching needs an obvious  change. Placement wise, it needs to improve.    "
"KJ Somaiya College of Engineering, Mumbai ","      One of the better colleges that comes under the Mumbai university (it was under MU for 3 of my 4 academic years). Autonomy took away a lot of charm from the college (for most people!). The college life was still good, but the exam pattern changed and as a result our scores dropped tremendously(the worst affected were students of electronics department)! Like in any other college, faculty is a mix of good and average. The infrastructure is there but implementation is not up to the mark! However, the placements of this college are good.The college life and campus are excellent.   "
"KJ Somaiya College of Engineering, Mumbai ","      The Somaiya Vidyavihar campus is very captivating. Full size athletic tracks enclosing a professional full size football ground. Facilities for every major sport. Huge open spaces - be it classrooms, labs, common areas, etc. No A/C though :( Decent crowd diversity with a healthy amount of gujjus as this is a Gujarati minority college. College life is good. Annual college festivals are good and getting better year-by-year. Lots of places to hang around both inside the campus or outside. Attendance won't be an issue unless you're critically low (happy bunking!). The new autonomous system includes a GPA grading structure, so every exam is important. This is good as regular studies help in the long run and of course for the final semesters. Teachers are above average but it ultimately depends on you. The amount of interest and willingness you exhibit is directly proportional to your growth both academically and otherwise. Placements are above average. This is one of the best colleges to do Mechanical Engineering from. Other fields include Comps, I.T., Electronics and EXTC. All of them are decent too. Also enquire or keep an eye out for international student exchange. Yes, international! You can get an opportunity to study for a semester (or more) at some of the premium unversities in USA (or other countries too). Generally, notices are uploaded on college website but asking around won't hurt. Library is decent enough. Two hostel options available - Polytechnic and MBA hostels. Polytechnic would be your regular hostel, MBA being modern and on the expensive side. All in all, KJSCE is one of the best colleges to spend the productive years of your life and graduate from. All the best!    "

That's a plus.Student activities - Many societies and very creative ideas. Students really work hard through financial support from college end is not much. I haven't had any as such bad experiences, expect for the faculty part. Senior professors are very knowledgeable but most of them have retired. The new generation of professors is very bad. They can barely speak proper English and don't know the subject matter either. Syllabus is not taught completely. Lectures are taken for the sake of taking and favoritism is practiced by most professors. Research work is not inculcated amongst students. It's a simple rat race in which assignments and tests are given with one simple purpose of getting maximum marks. Not all professors are bad. So it's totally luck dependant. If u get the good Prof u are lucky. Lab facilities are a little outdated but I have seen improvement after passing out. Many new types of equipment have been bought. And efforts are being taken for the same. Plus the institute is over 125yrs old and thus has a very influential effect on your overall profile. If only the syllabus is improvised and professors are chosen correctly maybe it can regain it's overall rank.

"Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai  (Also known as: VJTI Mumbai) ","      The campus of VJTI is huge, one might even get lost initially. Lots of open space, a cricket and a football field, tennis courts and basketball court are available for recreational activities. However the buildings being old, the classrooms and the labs are not places youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll enjoy being in.Hostel facilities are available but are pretty old and obsolete. Twin or triple sharing rooms are usually not clean.Departments like Information Technology and Mechanical have excellent teachers. There is a lot of room for research work in these departments. Above average teaching in other branches, but you cannot expect more from professors of a government engineering institute. However, the importance of professors is much more here because of its autonomous nature. Many times the questions asked in the final exams are straight from the professorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ notes. Many experienced faculties have retired in the recent past and the new appointees do not match them in knowledge, qualifications or experience. However, they make up for all these with their enthusiasm and friendly nature.Placements at VJTI are certainly top notch. The college has consistently maintained the cent percent streak for most of the department. The name of the institute and its legacy are enough to get excellent placements, perhaps the best in Mumbai after IIT-B. Multinational companies like Microsoft (16 lpa), Google (19.95 lpa), Goldman Sachs, Oracle, Morgan Stanely, Yahoo and Deloitte also place a few students sometimes.VJTI canteen is certainly not bad for a government college.The food is damn cheap and tasty, too. Ragada Samosa (Rs. 20), Fried Rice (Rs. 35) and Samosa Pav (Rs. 10) are the hot favourites. Non-vegetarians also wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t regret.The crowd at VJTI is sad; rather, nerdy would be more appropriate. Students get engrossed when it comes to technical festivals, be it their own college fest or any other, and this happens all round the year.Technovanza is the technical festival of VJTI. Pratibimb is the cultural festival and Enthusia is the sports festival. Many other fests organized by hostel folks are held all-round the year.All the Fests take place usually in the month of December.The SOCIETY OF ROBOTICS N AUTOMATION Is damn too good.They have participated in various international competitions too e.g: Robocop 2014 and represented India.

To be  truthful, you will hardly find any faculty speaking fluent and grammatically correct English. God knows who recruits the faculty in VJTI. Coming to placements, almost every student in each branch except civil is placed. CIVIL is drought hit with respect to placements. There are very strict rules on promoting sports. You will hardly get funds from college to promote your event in fest.    "

"Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai  (Also known as: VJTI Mumbai) ","      Faculty of the Civil branch is excellentÃ¢â‚¬Â, says a final year student. Departments like Information Technology and Mechanical have excellent teachers. There is a lot of room for research work in these departments. Above average teaching in other branches, but you cannot expect more from professors of a government engineering institute. However, the importance of professors is much more here because of its autonomous nature. Many times the questions asked in the final exams are straight from the professorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ notes. Many experienced faculties have retired in the recent past and the new appointees do not match them in knowledge, qualifications or experience. However, they make up for all these with their enthusiasm and friendly nature.   "
"Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai  (Also known as: VJTI Mumbai) ","      ""Attendance:At VJTI, Civil branch is very strict about attendance. For other branches, it is not much of an issue, on a simple condition that you do not spoil your relations with the professors. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Panga mat lena mere dostÃ¢â‚¬Â says a final year Computers student. However, there are always exceptions and you have to identify those professors and attend their lectures regularly. Canteen:VJTI canteen is certainly not bad for a government college. There are cleanliness issues; often it stinks a bit, but overflowing with students most of the times. Though it is quiet spacious, during lunch break, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to strive hard to find a place. The food is damn cheap and tasty, too. Ragada Samosa (Rs. 20), Fried Rice (Rs. 35) and Samosa Pav (Rs. 10) are the hot favorites. Non-vegetarians also wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t regret.""   "

"Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai  (Also known as: VJTI Mumbai) ","      Known to be Mumbai's best local engineering college, VJTI attracts almost all the state toppers who couldn't get into the IITs and other national institutes. However, once you get in there, you realise its not as good as it is generally perceived by the locals. The infrastructure is pretty bad, with extremely old building. The teachers, too, are just average and nothing great about them. But a plus point of this institute is the laboratory equipment which they generally use(except for CSE of course). The canteen is great but tends to get overcrowded at times. An important factor people keep in mind while joining VJTI is that the placement record is pretty decent and consistent. Almost 100% placement every year. The college has a large football and cricket ground(which are quite good). All in all, I'd suggest that VJTI should be the last option for anyone aiming for a top institute like IITs or BITS.   "

"Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai",      I still remember the time when i completed my 10+2 and without doubt i wanted to get into good college. But all hardship lead me to DBIT. Initially i felt it was good college not upto the mark but knowledge wise i feel it was great place. Since i didnt opted any coaching class through out my curricullum i felt it wont be possible to clear all the paper without the faculty support. I was able to make lot of friends during my engineering course. And location wise is concerned it was near from vidyavihar station with 10min walking distance also bus and auto facilities are available. As far as infarstructure is concerned it could have better and there was limited time alloted for sport activity. But we have got lot of support while conducting extracurricular activity which is the best part. But in the it is the placement which decide your future and as far as mech branch is concerned i can say there was hardly any core company came for recruitment only few land up in good company luckly i was one of them. But i felt after my graduation completion lot of thing has been change like HOD of mech has became principle of our college. As far as HOD of mech is concern she is a great inspiration for me and i feel in upcoming year placement would be better for mechanical branch also.
"Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai","     The college is good, excellent crowd, average placements but the activities on campus are amazing. The faculties of computer department are helpful, albeit a little strict. Overall it was an excellent experience of my life. Phoenix mall nearby good hangout place. Lots of good places to eat around the campus. Canteen is okayish very less variety and not a very affordable menu."
"Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai","      Life at DBIT was a mix of challenges, learning and fun. It was a journey which helped me gain knowledge, ascertain passion and develop communication and interpersonal skills. It was a roller coaster ride, as each term passed we faced new challenges in the form of new subjects. Life at DBIT helped me developed bonds with the faculty and colleagues and finally a memory to cherish forever."
"Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai",     The college has a good campus environment. 2 open grounds give it a grand feel. The library has a wide array of books to refer and borrow but is seldom used by students. Only major complaint would be the computers as they don't regularly function. The fees are also high as compared to other colleges.
"Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai","     Don Bosco Institute of Technology (DBIT) is located at the Don Bosco, Kurla campus in front of the Kohinoor City.

"Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai",     it is very proud feeling to say that awesome college for engineering in Mumbai.college infrastructure is good if someone outside person visits college they appreciate after leaving college.

There is always visiting of many foreign peoples inside the college campus. Placement for mechanical engineers was less in earlier days but nowadays placement for them increasing every year. Students of don't bosco are very creative and also very interactive. Various festivals and activities are conducted by students as well as staffs.
"Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai","     Thankfully, my core foundation of values, ethics, work and study culture so on and so forth were made solid when I was in school. If it were not for those days, I would not even be half the man I am today. The mindset of Professors all across the country, specially in government funded/aided academies needs to change. They need to feel responsible of the influence they have on young minds an they need to look beyond the textbook and give students a wholesome experience of education. It isn't always what you remember on the day of the exam that counts, that is secondary or tertiary even. It is about how to make a man out of a boy, how he is supposed to think in the real world and how being a suck-up is not the only way to get to the top."
"Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai","     It was a pleasant experience with lots of learning involved which also included extra curricular activities. Good faculty keeping us up to date with the latest in electronics & telecommunications technology & infrastructure. There are 4 streams in which you can do your engineering which included Computer science, IT, mechanical & electronics & telecommunications engineering. The college is under Mumbai university & is rated as one of the best colleges in Mumbai for engineering. Located on the eastern side of Vidhyavihar railway station , it is close to the station & caters to the need of students all around Mumbai in terms of location. The placements for IT & computers are exceptional but low for mechanical & extc. Along with education it instills discipline in the students & provides a comfortable atmosphere for holistic growth of the student."

There are other colleges which have this reservation, but relatively dbit has good campus facilities and well equipped labs. I had been to many other colleges before filling out the forms and i felt this campus was really good. There are a very few engineering colleges in Mumbai which have a ground. During the campus visit i saw, dbit had 3 separate in-campus grounds for respective sports. So this was also a significant driving factor to take admission in this college"
"Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai","It was closer to my house compared to other colleges. It has good facilities, really good canteen. I took a tour before applying the campus was quite nice consisting of 2 grounds and a separate parking area.

"Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai",This college was one of the 7-8 colleges which had christian minority. And Don Bosco is the best among those. The reviews I read about the college were good and many of my friends also suggested the college is great. I had few faculty contacts also in the college and their response was also that its a good college with great academics and campus life to enjoy and study at the same time. ALso the main factor was travelling and I wanted the college in a less travel duration and hence came to the conclusion of this college.
"Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai",One of the finest college in mumbai. I will refer all students searching for good college in mumbai should consider this.
"Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai","The college infrastructure is very good, plus it's famous for being a sport centric college.

"Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai","Overall, I'd give the college a 7.5/10. It's still a budding college with a lot more to develop on. The infrastructure is constantly being worked on to make it better for the students everyday and the ambience is great. One of the main drawbacks of the college is that's its too damn far, that's all. Like even after you get down at a bmtc bus stop, there's like a kilometer or more of walking to do just to reach class. But eh well, at least it keeps us healthy with all that walking."
"Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai",     College provides good facilities and has good teaching staff.
"Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ",     No doubt it is one of the best colleges in city. Infrastructure is way too good and ahead in terms of many other colleges. Faculties are friendly and beloved principal sir is a cool person. But sadly it's not what it seems. Placement cell is one of the worst ones i have ever heard. The amount of politics there is ruining students careers. Mind you i am a placed student. The placement cell is headed by a sir who has lots of airs about his so called Connections in industry. He refuses to address to student's concerns. Fine you have a committee at your disposal but some problems can't be handled by them and when students ask you. You are plain rude and not approachable. In the name of 100 percent placement you are forcing students to sit for mass recruitments after which you are not allowed to apply for any further placement drives. The only ones allowed are the ones he wants to or the ones placement committee knows. Students are sitting here with single job offer and not allowed to apply for more even if they want to. And people from placement cell are there with 3 job offers. Politics runs in Placement cell and the one who manages it. The whole placement scenario is a big facade. Half of my friends are unplaced. That half in total is almost 500. Trust me don't sit for mass recruitments. You will get a better job later on.

The admission process was pretty simple. I got my admission through cap round. They considered my MHCET score. I considered two aspects of college selection- 1) Campus and job opportunities, 2) travelling.

"Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ","      Infrastructure:Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology (RAIT) is housed in a spacious building, part of the huge DY Patil Campus which is home to many other sister institutes. Most of the canteens and faculties are connected internally and there is considerable interaction among people from different faculties. There are close to half a dozen labs (And we mean well maintained ones!). Even though the college is situated in the DY Patil Deemed University campus it is affiliated to University of Mumbai.Placements:Records are good and average salary offered was around Rs. 3.25 lac p.a. for the previous year. The major recruiter is Infosys. Great progress has been made in the recent years and students claim that RAIT placements are now at par with the best colleges in Mumbai. Faculty:RAIT has some really dedicated professors.

RAIT is never lifeless). People are into Computers, rock music...rock music and computers. Half of RAIT comprises cyber nuts the other half sleep on guitars. Canteen:Strangely enough RAIT canteen (managed by Anna) serves good food at very reasonable rates. Thali, Vada Pav, Masala Dosa are favourites. The ambience has been recently upgraded and now attracts students from every department be it medicine or law and of course engineering. The change has been so drastic that alumni who haven't been to their college for long, can't believe it's the same canteen. Hangouts:The basement is the site of all underground and nefarious activities. It houses the engineering canteen and the medical canteen. (Medical? Well the engineering & medical colleges are in the same building & engineering guys share a special relationship with the medicals) Off campus: Dosa Plaza, Rangoli, CCD, Domino's and the DY Patil stadium. Festivals:""Kalaraag"" is RAIT's cultural fest that is purely dedicated to performing arts and English, Hindi and prominently Marathi theatre.

"Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur ",     College life in V.E.S.I.T is exciting because of all the festivals and days celebrated through out the year. The college is bit strict about the timings of this festivals but they are very well organized. The placements are good with many companies visiting. We are blessed with an amazing infrastructure and facilities. The students crowd here is very enthusiastic. The labrotaries are well equipped and the faculty is good.

"Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur ","     The infrastructure is very good and spacious. It takes the students to Industry Visits for corporate exposure.

In all one of the best colleges in Mumbai university.
"Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur ","     The college has a great infrastructure and sufficient place to host a number of events, activities, seminars, etc. The crowd is encouraging in itself, faculty varies from average to good where some teachers do not have sufficient knowledge and the ability to deal with questions being asked by students and there are some who simply excel in their domain. The college locality is not that great but the campus is huge and breathtaking. It should have more industrial visits or some great industrialists visiting the campus and sharing the latest trends would help to increase industry exposure. All events taking place have time restrictions imposed by higher authorities, which is something a hindrance for a college student. Whether it be the annual Utsav or tech fest, they cannot exceed 5pm, which is not desirable. College does not support startup based placements which are not desirable. Even the startups are a great place to learn and explore opportunities, but the college is against that. Hostel food remained the worst expect a few surprises. Students from different parts of the state take admissions here and so there is decent diversity and it helps students to communicate with people from different walks of life, celebrate different festivals with friends, overall the crowd is great, one gets to learn a lot."
"Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur ","     Pros.

Less industrial exposure, follows outdated syllabus, very less focus on innovation, RCF is right next to the campus, so occasional chemical odors"
"Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur ","     The college is there since 1985 and relocated to a new campus- HASHU ADVANI MEMORIAL COMPLEX in the year 2000. Although the locality around VESIT is not that good, but once inside the campus its a different world. The infrastructure is awesome with a huge library.Each department has different floors with huge and well-equipped labs. The faculty is very knowledgeable and student-centric. VESIT has great records of 100 % placement in top IT companies. Appealing canteen in terms of food and ambience. A lot of variety in food is available and at reasonable prices. The hostel is good without any issues of ragging. The Mess is excellent. However, there is a scarcity of hot water in some floors."
"Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur ","     I had a great 4 years in this college. This college has given me great friends, my first job, beautiful memories which have made an impression for a lifetime. Though the college fests were not carried out on a large scale but they definitely taught us team spirit and organizational skills. The faculty is helpful and placements are pretty good."
"Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur ",     Renowned companies are invited for the placements. They have good lab setups so that students can have a real life industry experience (for instrumentation engineering). If you are interested doing something in the field of process engineering this is the best college you can get into.
"Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur ","     The college begins with Prarambh, that is the fresher's party. The college gives plenty amount of opportunities to showcase your hidden talents. Events like debate, group discussion, story writing etc take place in the VESLIT week of literature. Praxis, the technical fest is famous for its mind-boggling events. The cultural fests like Illusions and Utsav actively participate and celebrated by the students in huge numbers. The faculty of the college makes their best efforts in making sure everyone understands what's being taught in class. The doubts are also cleared from time to time. The society's like Music, Cultural, SoRT etc helps in personality development. One must know how to make influential impressions on the faculty as well as the students of the senior batches. It's a learning centre for those interested in learning."
"Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur ","     The faculty is good, excellent placement, the crowd is nice, infrastructure is as per the student need, students are helpful. A lot of cocurricular activities take place. There cultural activities too. 4 To 5 fests are conducted. The college has been going for inter-college fests and fresh face contest. It has won many competitions. I had also taken part in one of the fests and it was an amazing experience."
"Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur ","     Referred to one of the best colleges in Mumbai, VESIT fails to live up to the expectations. If you are expecting a Jump Street sort of college or a place where you can bunk, this is NOT the place you are looking for. Labs are well equipped in comparison with other engineer colleges. Teachers do not teach well but are good-natured (few exceptions exist). Attendance is strict (75%) which if you fail to achieve leads to assignments or sometimes even parents are called. The crowd consists of decent people from Mumbai (mostly central) and also a few hostilities. You would rarely find yourself bunking the college for a movie Bunking in VESIT refers to sitting in the canteen or going back home. Placements are decent (around 70%) with average packages of 3 lpa (Accenture being the mass recruiter). Extc and extra students end up picking up IT jobs as core companies pick a max of 3 students and you end up competing with some of the best students you can find in an engineer. Instruct students get core companies quite easily. Canteen is cheap but the quality of food is not good. You would enjoy the time Sphoorti comes up. But that would be one of the very few times you will enjoy being in the college. If you are looking for a ""college life"" college, go for other options."
"Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur ",     They are more into attendance than teaching some important stuff. People and crowd are really Boring and more into books and marks than into Technical knowledge. Attendance is the real issue here and faculties are very arrogant. Placement is limited to Accenture with max 4 lakh annual package. Shortage of girls people and students are really not cooperative. HODs think that they are the owner of the college. Located near slum areas. 40 rs auto from Kurla and Chembur. Events and fests are not so Energetic and enjoyable. Full of lame and selfish people. No playground.
"Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur ","     College is great! Faculty is brilliant, placement is excellent especially for Instrumentation Engineering. There are various cultural as well as technical festivals held per year. 3-4 technical societies are currently active. Instrumentation Engineering is the best branch here because principle is from Instrumentation faculty only."
"Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur ",      Though the locality of VESP is not good but it's really awesome when you enter in the college. But it's very strict.

Campus is really good.Presently, as an outsider I can say that VESIT is academically as well as games and activity wise an excellent college.Good atmosphere exists and it should be the first choice after SPCE/VJTI (VJTI in fact may loose out in long term).""   "
"Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur ",      Vesit is a best college for students aspiring for further studies as well as in job perspective as many companies come for recruitment company like Accenture take away more than 50 percent of the crowd.

"Terna Public Charitable Trust's Terna Engineering College, Navi Mumbai ","      Terna engineering college lags basic infrastructure such as adequate working computers and printing machines.The entire department depends on upon a single printer assigned to it which is also used by other departments at times.Our college could increase corporate exposure by taking initiatives to be more outgoing and invite other colleges and hold competitions on a state as well as national level and stop focusing just on academics.The college also does not kindle the interest among students to innovate and only favours the students who achieve high scores thus being biased and partial.College life could be more happening if various imminent guests were invited and various competitions could be held which would make Terna famous and be a sought after college.The placements are the lowest point to be mentioned about the college, as they follow the mantra that if a student does not make it into TCS it is the end of his career graph and he is left to fend for himself.Other than TCS, only two or three companies come for campus placements hence leaving a majority of the students unplaced.The college faculty would repeatedly harass students based on presentations and journals sending the students back and forth for correcting petty issues (such as drawing lines, changing an order of questions,etc) thus wasting the students valuable time .The students are friendly but mostly speaking in the local dialect thus creating a language and social barrier.The college is affordable as the fees are quite low.

"Terna Public Charitable Trust's Terna Engineering College, Navi Mumbai ","      College Infrastructure - After looking at this college, we feel it needs some kind of resurrecting element to enhance its beauty. Frequent reconstruction resulted  in no improvement to date.Faculty- Poor in terms of knowledge. You have to rely on external resources(paid). Sometimes you feel like going on and teaching them. Lack of dedicated and experienced faculties.Placement- Decent. Only toppers get placement, need others are fooled. The Placement officer lacks professionalism.Labs- The college needs a lot of improvising. Most of the instruments are faulty. Only promises of improvement are made. There is a shortage of printer, so submissions could be the nightmare. Printer-student ratio is 1:60.Hostel- Lack of space as the hostel is shared among dental and engineering students.Campus- The college has a big ground but it is not maintained well.Life- Life seems to be dull, boring.

"Terna Public Charitable Trust's Terna Engineering College, Navi Mumbai ","      TPCT's Terna Engineering College is a good option for a Navi Mumbai resident, try traveling time may come handy for a Mumbaikar with the frequent train issues at  harbour line.But the college quite near(just a 3-5 min walk )from Nerul Station.Infrastructure is decent and has improved within past few months with a new library/reading room being built(which is amazing). The college has a good, big ground at the center of its campus. The college has a newly built auditorium which you can be proud of. There is a nice little pond with few fishes which is situated at the back end of the college. Course & Faculty- The college has introduced a new branch called ""Mechatronics""  last year which is  introduced first time in any college in Mumbai University.The college has a handful of good teachers and that's where it lags behind when compared with other Navi Mumbai colleges.The attendance is very strict and if you don't complete the much required 75% then you may have to solve previous year question papers and you end up getting quite fewer marks in internals and in a worst case your parents may also be called. The college also has a ""TecRobo"" lab which has been set up by IIT Bombay, so if you love robotics you will enjoy here.Industry Exposure is now increased with a couple of courses organized by the college to really make you learn what industry needs.Canteen- A new canteen has been built, quite read quite a reasonable price and a large number of items available. But most of the students enjoy hostel's mess food which is much better than canteen(making you realize your home's taste).Festivals-There are a few festivals organized in Terna  like Resonance(cultural fest) and Avalon(technical festival).Most of the students participate in Avalon and mainly the event is robot-centered.A no of sports events are organized like cricket, volleyball, badminton, etc.The college also has something who is good at acting, dancing, singing, etc which is organized by Antarang, a cultural committee.Placements- The college has a quite decent placement, Hexaware, around 50%-60%  students get placements here. TCS is the major recruiter while IGHexaware, Atos, etc are also recruiters.College Life-You will enjoy here but at the same time, you have to work hard at the same time.   "

"Shivajirao S Jondhale College of Engineering, Thane","     I passed out from this pathetic college long back... and I had taken an oath that i would never see this campus. we were among the first few batches where college was just opened and it was in horrible state. Other than engg drawing, in my 4 years study, I couldn't find a single person whom I can call sir from bottom of my heart. Absolutely waste quality. One professor used to teach Microprocessor and used to give marks based on number of pages answer written. No jokes folks that was the case. One person used to force to attend his private coaching. Hope he is not there now. I feel ashamed of saying my college name in my organisation. My suggestion is that if you don't get any college then keep this as last priority as it is coming under Mumbai university. Placement was 0 at that time. you have to literally hop in rainy days to reach that barren land."

Faculty doesn't upgrades the knowledge of the students with the upcoming technology in the world related to the engineering course that we are doing. they are still teaching the 1980s engineering standards. the world has moved ages out of that is what needs to be told to the management and faculty.

"Atharva College of Engineering, Malad","     Awesome environment during fests. You can live your college days to the fullest. At the same time placements are good. But for studies ,it's all your responsibility. It's not a big deal to study on your own. Faculty is nice. But you won't sit for lectures,would you?"
"Atharva College of Engineering, Malad",    The caste system affects the crowd real bad and so is the faculty based on caste system. The facilities are good but in the electrical department the faculty needs improvement and the provision must be improved. Really clean and they take care of the college more than the students.
"Atharva College of Engineering, Malad",     We Had fun. Faculty was good. Professors are good. Some of them can actually provide core knowledge.

"Atharva College of Engineering, Malad",College is good well maintained infrastructure and well maintained everything from toilet to floors everything is good they have their own ground which are well maintained with sports facilities. Everything is good.
"Atharva College of Engineering, Malad","Students' life in this college is easier since the attendance was not as strict compared to other colleges. But the faculty and seriousness among the pupils about technology, engineering, and scopes as a whole could have been pushed a little higher than it used to be."
"Atharva College of Engineering, Malad","Nothing bad, very supportive. Should focus more on practical approach of learning."
"Atharva College of Engineering, Malad",My overall thinking about my college is very positive and I'm gonna miss my college and my friends a lot thanks.
"Atharva College of Engineering, Malad",The college is not far away from my residency which reduced the travelling time so that I can concentrate on academics. The department which I wanted was good. The college has good campus and I had heard good reviews regarding the teaching staff and the way of providing education. The teaching staff is very helpful.
"Atharva College of Engineering, Malad",College is a good well maintained infrastructure. Professors are very good at teaching and very helpful. Greenery is the eye-catcher of my college.

"Atharva College of Engineering, Malad","Firstly It is very near to my house,hardly 35 minutes it takes to travel. Then i heard about this college as it is ranked in top 20 private colleges in Mumbai, It has a great infrastructure which I googled first. Then the thing which I loved was: In this college there is no pressure of attendance.The teachers here are so friendly that they allows you to do some productive things by not attending the class.Attendance here is at low priority only if you are involved in doing something, if they found you just roaming & bunking the class they will shoot you at PTA meeting (parent's-teacher's meet).Teachers allows you to build projects by waiting with you even after the college timing."
"Atharva College of Engineering, Malad","College looks good and but it lacks lots of things from inside. Labs sucks, most of equipments are either faulty or don't work at all. In chemistry lab we are even allowed to perform full experiment instead they give us all ready prepared chemicals and directly tell us to perform final test and sometimes they just show you."
"Atharva College of Engineering, Malad","Really good if you want to amp up your social life and groom yourself. Mobile phones are not allowed to be used in the campus so that is a negative point, it can only be used in laboratories and washrooms and sometimes in canteen, not in classrooms."
"Atharva College of Engineering, Malad",     The first thing that anyone notices about this college is its canteen. It is maintained by the hotel management college situated in the same campus. So its quite good. Good library with a large number of books of all branches. Also there are all year round fests which is a great thing.

"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane",    The teaching provided is excellent. Proper study notes provided. Everyone including faculties and management is helpful. Institute puts lots of efforts to improve. E-learning facilities are really good. Very good library facility. Very good labs. Different programs to improve skills of student required for jobs and startups.
"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane",I have heard that other colleges provides print for practical experiment's write up and students supposed to fill up blank spaces after taking readings from experiment. This is really time consuming.But in my college this thing is absent. I really feel that this should be adopted by my college.
"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane","The main reason for applying to this college was that it was only 20 minutes away from my home. Also, heard good reviews from my seniors."
"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane","College is having good staff and APSIT team is very supporting. College is good at taking initiatives .

The class rooms are well organized with advanced technology. College conducts seminars, workshops, national and international conferences to update the development in the fields of science and technology."
"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane","Positive : facilities, labs, cleanliness, knowledge of staff Negative: staff attitude, lack of placements, and specially backward thinking, college is a place were both girls and boys would meet be friends and be as one, no discrimination, but here, specially in mechanical, they don't allow girls and boys to sit together, even if they see u being friendly with a girl, u would be called to HOD cabin and warning would be given to stay away, mechanical staff is more of like bajrang dal then teachers"
"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane","A college is full of passion, whose faculty are the best inevery branch ( EXTC, IT, CS, MECH, CIVIL) of engineering.The college takes care of student's comfortability verywell and is really very understanding. College is also very supportive of implementing new ideas from students."

"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane","APSIT is one of the best emerging colleges in Mumbai. The college environment is very friendly. All the faculties are well experienced and have expertise in their respective fields. Lectures and practicals are conducted regularly. The infrastructure of the college is too good.

"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane","Good infrastructure, cooperative faculty, nice classrooms, well-developed labs. I got more confident after taking admission in the college"
"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane",No negative remarks. My college has improved a lot over the year. They've grown exponentially for the benefit of student only. Constant updates have been made to the college policies to make life at apsit better for the students.
"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane",The college Higher authorities take good initiatives to take college at a high level.
"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane",The college have been grade A grade by grading organization also the college has been applied for NBA ACCREDITIONthis year and mostly will get it done
"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane",Apsit is the best college for education. Here education is based on project-based learning. Infrastructure is in well manner. The important thing is there is no ragging. Labs are technically great. Classes are fully air conditioner.
"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane","Negative remarks are only that the college doesn't have its own hostel and students need to accomodate in PG near the college. And all other points like Academics, Infrastructure and Placement are quite positive and very impressive."
"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane",College is in great place and seniors are also very helpful. Environment of college is good as you mix in it. Just the college is a little far away from main stations.
"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane","    Faculty of the institute is one of the best in MU. Many extra curricular activities are also conducted frequently. We have our cultural fest- just, a sports fest and tech fest as well. Since ours will be the first batch to graduate, can't take a call on placements. Bt I am sure that college will arrange for good placements. No college campus as such. Yet best infrastructure. Each and an every classroom is air conditioned. Playground for students also missing!"
"AP Shah Institute of Technology, Thane","    Nice infrastructure, but no ground. All the educational-purpose-machineries are new. The campus is small. AP Shah has really good professors, all hired from the good colleges of the university of Mumbai. For other years, there are some brilliant faculties and a lot of average faculties. We have air-conditioned class rooms and two common rooms where students can play. Attendance is not a big issue. You can bunk if you want to a certain limit. Canteen is not so good. Limited VEG dishes are available. The college has a stilt-parking facility which occupies the whole ground floor of the college. And the rest of the floor of the college. And the rest of 4 floors are for educational purposes. AP shah has 2 seminar hall of small sizes. The college also provides foreign language classes amongst which courses are available for Germen, French and Japanese."
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     College is good but no campus type thing .if we talk about library then it is also good ..practical lab also there in a good condition mostly all apparatus and machine are there. One more thing canteen, it contain both nonveg and veg food at average price not very high or low ..overall i can say very good college."
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ",     I am studying in this college as a mechanical engineering student and first of all you all that the crowd is superb in this college. Teaching is mind blowing and the teaching staffs are very much supportive in this college . In this college they mostly concentrate on practical sessions rather than theory one. And they prepare you to the next level that after completing college they make sure that u will get job by campus placement that's a good part.
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ",     1.Does not have enough space for labs. 2.Should think upon teaching quality. 3. The only good point is the location of the college.It has the presence in one of the most beautiful places in mumbai i.e. carter road bandra. 4.very less companies visiting the campus. 5.Teachers are under qualified for new syllabus. 6.lowest fee. 7.Sea shore near the college makes it memorable. 8.college has to improve in every means ... i.Should improve their infrastructure. ii. Should appoint experienced and qualified teachers. iii. Should have active placement cell to have good placements. iv. Should have good lab equipment.
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ",     In RIZVI you get different environment and u can expose yourself can even interact with Architecture and management student as the are in the same campus there is a huge canteen where u ca. Meet ur new friend and can enjoy ur college life as college location is in Bandra carter road is an amazing glamorous place where u can hang out with ur friends the faculty of computer Department is good even for computer Rizvi is best it has amazing faculty and equipment.
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     While the location might seem appealing, the limitations of being in a residential area with no campus to speak of can provide a sharp reality check. The college is a Minority Institution and that does seem to play a decisive role in the overall outlook of the faculty and students and leads to a perception of nepotism in some cases. At one time it charged the lowest fees among all the Mumbai University colleges thanks to its limited infrastructure. The Teaching staff seemed to be changing on a yearly basis with former students being inducted into the teaching faculty after passing out. These newly inducted faculty would teach subjects from the viewpoint of scoring marks in the university exams rather than ensuring that the students understood the subject being taught. The office staff were quite helpful and offered excellent support to resolve any complicated problems in matters relating to the university. There was no hostel attached to the college, but its canteen provided a wide selection at affordable rates. However, Canteen space was shared with the multitude of other institutions in the same premises and was woefully short in capacity to serve them all. The Civil stream was lucky enough to have greater exposure to the industry due to the nature of the stream leading to the proximity of multiple active construction projects in the area, but none of the other streams managed to organise an industrial visit for their students during the same time period. While the library held a decent selection of books, their condition was rather poor. Classroom ventilation is poorly planned and this can lead to hot and stuffy classrooms in the summer months and in late October. Laboratory equipment may not always be in the best shape, though the college did spend for some new equipment when final year projects required it."
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     Overall the college provides a good atmosphere to learn. The faculties are friendly, no issues with that. Also, the research work going on in the college is way too much. Incase you are a research type of student, the college will help you out. The canteen food might be an issue sometimes."
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     It's a nice college. The crowd is pretty okay. Infrastructure is good Better than many colleges in fact. Has a really huge canteen which is amazing and the faculty is good as well. The location of the college is another plus point. Has the most amount of seats for civil and the best part is the if you're doing civil engineering like me, you are learning about building from a builders college. ."
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ",     Sea facing collage with awesome faculty. My life taking several tose turn during my collage but all thing getting fade away as i enter my collage with my friend's and teachers all around me with great enthusiasm chearing m all over in my each and every step for my even small. small problem
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ",     There’s no college ground but there are lots of public grounds nearby for sports enthusiasts especially cricket which beats in every Rizvites heart. The toilets often stink; so it is advised that you finish off your stuff at home. The infrastructure is improving though.
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     A couple of years ago there were pretty good teachers but due to some unknown reasons the staff keeps changing. But now the teachers are Ph. D graduate and experienced. Very few colleges in Mumbai can beat the location of Rizvi College of Engineering. It's off the plush Carter road promenade and behind Pali Hill, home of many celebrities."
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ",     You can just come for practicals and study at home for the remaining time. So many students score out here. Imagine going to college right from 9 am to 5 pm and then rest of the evening being spent completing assignments. You can't even think of studying under such circumstances. Life is simple at Rizvi.
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     You can come and go any time you want to, you are your own ""marzi ka malik"". Some teachers do threaten about attendance but that is just a formality. Years pass on and attendance keeps on falling. It's no big deal in Rizvi rather it turns out to be a plus point for students"
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     Crowd at Rizvi College of Engineering is predominantly Muslim due to the 50% quota. Overall, the crowd is pretty cool and the fact that Engineering college has Law, Science, Commerce, Arts, Architecture and Management colleges attached to it; means that you might get a chance to mingle with some of the best looking ones (if not engineering) in the locality (the canteen is common for all)."
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     The Rizvi College of Engineering canteen is a paradise for non- veggies. It's really big; hence airy, well ventilated and mostly very crowded. You can get some of the tastiest food here. The prices won't be heavy on your pocket and yes, no one brings TIFFIN in Rizvi, so good is the canteen. The seating is very comfortable. Food available varies from Chaat to Chinese, traditional thalis and what not. Don’t forget to try the Bhurji-pav here."
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     A college in which you can spend 4 years with peace and without any interference from the college management unless you end up doing something really crazy. just fill the papers and you pass (not literally though). But there are disadvantages to it as well, so enter at your own risk!!"
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     Each year more than 30 % to 40 % students are placed through this cell. The training and placement cell is active to keep touch with the industry and invites them to come and visit the institute for campus interviews. Mechanical and Civil departments get the best placements. But, there is no guarantee of placements."
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ",     Rizvi is a decent college for those score just about average marks in the entrance exam. Not too far from south Mumbai and easily accessible from western suburbs; so travelling is not an issue. A college in which you can spend 4 years with peace and without any interference from the college management unless you end up doing something really crazy
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     Best college in mumbai for mechanical and civil branches and placement is also well.now college improve there status and standard also.placement for civil & mechanical is the best in the whole of mumbai, GO for it and this time the col will offer almost 100% placement bcoz the is now very much impproved"
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     the faculty is inexperienced but friendly and they help u out trust me.. And no rule followed as fill the paper and u pass.. The crowd is extremely friendly, supportive and for me- the best.. And also- there are issues with attendance now on, this year atleast 5 students from each year fell in trouble and weren't allowed to fill the university form, so be careful but the attendance % is not too high, you're considered even if its 25-30%."
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     the interior of the college has been improved to a gr8 xtent.....as far as the staff is concerned they completely suck to the core.....and attendance has been a much better priority now, concluding that you have to at least maintain your attendance record till 30%.....howeva once you land on carters its totally funtastic... :)"
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ",     Civil is the best because the trustees of rizvi are builders and if you are a smart one then you will surely get a job..The canteen is full of bedbugs so enter at your own risk ! You might carry some bedbugs at your home too... otherwise the food is good and reasonable
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ",     Attendance rules have been revised - Minimum 60% req. People who dont have 60% attendance are not eligible for the term test. Hangouts are good.. canteen is also good.. placements are decent (upto 60 to 70%).. civil is the best department in college..
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     Features Of RCOE: 1.Average faculty (Best for EXTC) 2.Best Canteen (Good space, Even Non Veg) 3.Don't worry for Your Attendance. 4.Average Placement (Just Perform well in exams) 5.Nearest Lovers point (Carters and Bandstand) 6- RAYS is the annual sports, cultural as well as technical fest of Rizvi College of Engineering"
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     I (EXTC student) will say college is good 3/5, but it's still Ungraded... More than half of the crowd in engineering is irresponsible & aren't bothered about studies... they just wanna pass with 40. Faculty with some exceptions is good (almost same as every other college). As said before you can perform well by taking advantage of low attendance criteria (avg 30-40%) & placements are less, as low number of students are eligible.. No Industrial Visit at all.. So if you want your engineering life calm and average, you can go for it... but you CANNOT ENJOY REAL ENGINEERING here..!!! Better for lovers, ok for smarties... all the best."
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","Really good for civil engineering. Advanced technology and methods of teaching. Good at sports especially for cricket. Admission is done via online process on the bases of MH CET marks,"
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","Rizvi college is good for placement in civil engineering. Admission is done via online process of DTE on the bases of CET marks. No online admission are there. Teaching methods are good, really good at sports especially cricket. Rizvi college is known for its cricket team. Small campus."
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ",Infrastructure is ok but overall a good college for that fees.
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ",The college is very good but there is always scope for improvement.
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ",College is good enough but there are certain points which lacks college so my college lacks a bit in infrastructure and campus but accordingly college is trying best to make it for students convenience and comfort study atmosphere.
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ",Negative review - 1. The college bulit their infrastructure by taking extra money from students which is wrong. 2. There are no grounds to play anything if you wish to play and not to study. Postive review - 1. Faculty members are good. 2. Marks are also given good.
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ",Our college does not solely depends on assignments for marks and they give marks on the basis of attendance and students knowledge and interest. Along with that each and every student is treated as family.
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","College is very good, offering a cost effective education to students, With a lot of scholarships. Faculty is nice. Students chill mostly in the canteen, it's a big canteen and can easily accommodate 100's of students. Overall it's a nice atmosphere mostly kids from nice background come to the college so the crowd is very good."
"Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra ","     Rizvi college is located in Bandra West off Carter Road. This college accepts students who can not get really high percentages. So it is a boon for students who score below 80% or less. Rizvi college has great infrastructure and also has lifts made available for students' use. Faculty is of great help as students can approach them anytime for any doubts. Also, the college has separate labs for physics, chemistry, biology, information technology, computer science and also a gymkhana where extra curricular activities take place. The college has an auditorium where the very famous 'JashneRizvi' takes place and celebrity judges are present every year. This college has great placements and is also one of the best colleges."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",     This is one of the best college I would say in Mumbai .I completed my engineering in 2014. amazing faculty who teaches you as your own child. Ready to help you all the time. Very few people knows that very famous film actor Mr.Kadar Khan Sir was a teacher in this college only he got his turning point of life into film industry due to one of our college functions only. So many companies comes for campus placement with handsome package. Its one of the best college I would recommend all to apply for this college.Your will learn lots of new things here infra is not much good but if u truly want to learn something then infra doesn't matters.
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","     As Our college is really popular, there are people coming from long distance. Infrastructure is not up to mark. Classrooms were sufficiently large but now it size has been reduced which is not sufficient for 80 students. some teachers aren't good either, they hardly match the expectations which is one of the major concern. Infrastructure is average as there is no possibility to increase the infrastructure as it surrounded by government assets on both the side. Our College is only sufficient for engineering but there is 8 to 12th school and jr. College, Diploma, Engineering college, IT also part time education is also available so there is mess"
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","     When you visit this institute you can feel by that ancient architecture, the type of technical experience it holds. When I first visited the campus attracted me a lot, but then it was like ""Hey, Where is the play ground."", as I was totally into the sports but this lack in the institute is a bit disappointing. Then I came to the studies, the faculties were up to my mark. For an average class student like me, the lectures were all of my understanding level. When it comes to the Canteen, it literally disappointed me, as compared to other my previous college cafeterias. The library & the AC seminar hall are at the best level. The main thing that attracted me is the Alma latifi hall wich comprises of a mosque too, which is an amazing sigh of this institute's ethics. The crowd mostly comprising of Muslim students is so ethical and delight. All the departments are well equipped with all its technical requirements. This college is going good so far as it's located at a place where we can accommodate from any place of Mumbai , mainly railways."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","     M.H saboo siddik is one of the old colleges in Mumbai and is regarded as one of the best in town. located at the heart of Mumbai near Nagpada Mumbai central it is known for it's mosque type infrastructure. The campus is quite huge but it includes several other courses too including junior college and diploma. The electronics faculty is good there are few teachers with less experience but has a great knowledge in field of electronics. Most of them will be found as headache, as they will only focus on completing the syllabus and term work. Placement i wish u prepare yourself mentally that u won't be getting placement from this college. Fees is increasing year by year by margin of 10K approx. Right now it is 110k INR, but here you'll learn to be strong mentally for sure."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",     Very nice college. Have good set of professor. Only lack in infrastructure. Have nice and well maintained labs. Much better than any any other Mumbai university affiliated college in civil engineering. Placement for our department is very bad not to blame the college almost same scenerio in all other M.U. colleges. The administration department is a pain. Fest aren't supported (financially).
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","     All this college has is cons (considering IT field, for other field ask or look up someone else's review) 1. Infrastructure - Old college still the same, not much upgrades said that they were gonna fit A.C's in the first year still after passing out the infra is as crappy as ever. Lab's are useless half computers not working. The ground is just for junior and school kids. Watchmen will not allow you to play so there goes your tp. 2. Placement - Horrible TPO only one or two good companies. That's why the most important thing to look at in an engineering college is placement which this college doesn't have. So that's why even if u are in the minority don't go for IT or COMPS in this college. 3. Industry exposure will be pretty clear to you from above point. That is zero exposure. 4. 80 % of staff is worthless don't know how to teach. Favour those who favour them in assignment term work and blah blah(which is there in almost all colleges BUT) that is ok but the worst part is attendance. You have to keep 75% or above for term work marks and also to submit assignments without any trouble. Since sitting in lectures which you can't understand or get any interest is compulsory, it is also at the same time waste of your intellect. Instead, you can study at home and score as well as gain knowledge then come here and sit like machines. 5. College life depends totally on your attitude. Go with those who come for only timepass, then you'll end up timepass even after completing 4 years. Go with studying crowd and end up with good academics(which is boring but funnily important). I would say be balanced. 6. Affordability - Scholarships are there for the minority as well as that Caste thingy. Nowadays almost all colleges are expensive. But according to the money you pay you to get 0 value 0 facilities."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","     College life is amazing, but that's only if you really want to enjoy. Infrastructure is fair enough. The faculty is just average. College placements are below average. College fests are amazing. College trips are Amazing It's good if u know how to find a way to enjoy else no college is good."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","     I am in first year SEM II. Till date, there is no problem with the faculty and other staff. Infrastructure is developing. There are also sports competitions and other seminars on technology. The teaching faculty is good and also experienced. The office faculty is mediocre. The best part is it is in south Mumbai so many destinations like Chowpatty, etc are nearby"
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","     Generally L & T, Wipro, Infosys, Godrej & Boyce, Tata Motors, etc. are few of the companies that visit this campus to meet their requirement of engineers. But don't go by the name of the companies, because the number of students placed is just around 50%. In the recession year 2009, they fell down to 20%. Average salary offered is around Rs. 2.4 lac p.a."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",     MH Saboo Siddik’s college of Engineering is one of the few colleges in Mumbai which offers automation engineering which makes it a noticeable college. If you are interested in that this college is a good option. Else the college is fairly OK. Attendance is required to approx 60%. If not there may be problems in store for you!
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","     its not a fairly /OK college . dude it got AA rating at state level, i studied here 3 years i can say it is above avg-good colleges. it is among top reputed old colleges of Mumbai. Regarding Hangouts- Dominoes and CCD are nearby. Others include McDonald's, KFC, Celejor, Monginis, Baskins & Robbins etc which are around 10 min walking distance."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",     college crowd is decent 50% r Muslims but that's not a problem as college-student r secular. placement now are 80%[eligible student's] those who worked hard 4 years really paid v.good handsome package. avg. package is some wht above 3 lkh also u will find less crowd in locals compared to other areas also nears local station is just 10 min walking distance. abt infrastructure it is 6-story huge building with large classrooms also there is a bank inside the campus only. max. faculty is good except one-two. there r many hangout near college also ;)
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","     teachers don't know to speak English! library is not ""extensive""..it is a dungeon not a library..girls are not allowed in the canteen..not allowed to wear capris or t shirt..no printers..no working pcs..the prominent hangout places are McDonalds, kfc, baskin & robins, domino's, cafe coffee day and a few hukka places."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",     I am in F.E Electronics.Its a decent and a nice college.And from this year on-wards the annual festival of the college is known as ''Ambrosia'' and not purple.The renovation of the college is going on and they are doing it very efficiently. Most of the teachers are good and have very good command over the subject. We all enjoy to be in the college. Overall I can say that its a very nice college.
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",     hey friends....the canteen here is horrible.....the college administration is absolutely ridiculous..... the library n office staff r really bad...toilets r lyk hell....it has got a good infrastructure but not properly maintained Bcoz of all the idiotic administrators who do have enough money but r not interested in using it for the college ...the only best top here is the neighboring jail where u can interact with the prisoners n have fun....
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",     i m happy that the college is renewed... and its process is still going on feels like we r in really standard college; the automobile and mechanical are highly qualified and experienced and also computer staff but don't have idea about other branches.
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",     The infrastructure is being revamped now and the interiors of the college definitely look much much better than before. The faculty is certainly not the best except a couple of profs. (in each of the branches). The canteen is perhaps going to be your last option even if you're hungry like hell!! The crowd's pretty decent.
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","     Canteen food may cause food poison so never prefer eating from there. Computers used in festivals for LAN gaming are outdated. They still play FIFA 2008 in 2015. The only positive which I can think of this college would be close to Byculla Station or Bombay Central and offers a decent degree. As for placements, 10 students were selected out of 60 in campus. So you will either have to stand out of other students or will have to look for off-campus placements."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","     I have passed in 2011 with Mechanical Degree from this college. The staff of MHSS is horrible and not helpful at all. In my four years of study, I have only found 2 professors out of 10 or 11 who were good in teaching (the teaching faculty of Mechanical Dept. has changed a bit)"
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",     The college is OK. Fests are not worth calling them as fests. Management is worst. Professors are good in Comps and IT dept. Placement is strictly OK for IT and comps dept and pathetic for other branches. Though it was memorable 4 years of my life. he food quality and taste is poor and it is advisable to carry your own tiffin.
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","     Easily reachable from anywhere in the city. Fees 98000. Canteen is poor, Faculty is OK, but don't help much. management is horrible and the college building isn't well-maintained. Hangouts- Jail visible from many classrooms. No sports facility, nearest open space is Shivaji Park. Crowd is pretty decent. Overall a good college but needs to improve in many ways."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",     College life was jst merely boring at the start but as we started events than it became a bit exciting. It is a developing college nw in terms of academics and cultural both. Jst the office staff needs to b more focused on work and college shld encourage their students in all aspects. The good thing is college is strictly enuf to avoid vulgarity in their campus
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","     The college faculty was good...extra curricular activities should be encouraged...also the office staff should be bit more co-operative... overall the college is good in terms of education..i would recommend this college for civil, automobile and Mechanical engineering... its well known college n still reigning...for other streams not bad..."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",     ETC faculty is supposed to be okay. New professors keep coming and going. Non teaching staff behave as the king n queen. (They dont even give respect to anyone) A well developed college getting a bad name because of such character. The college is still developing on infra..
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",The college has a good reputation from years. I had heard about good teaching. I got admission based on my entrance exam scores. My name came up after the 4th list. The overall admission process was very easy from the college.
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",Campus is not that interesting but teaching quality is good so I'm advising you do not take saboo siddik College until and unless you didn't get any college for engineering
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","Positive remark- Faculty is very supportive, learning environment is good, Hosting different cultural, technical festivals, Negative remark- Less Internships, Placement and Job opportunities are also too less, infrastructure can be improved."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","The overall infrastructure and atmosphere of the college are quite good. Quality facilities are offered by the college. The queries of the students are taken care of really well. I got into this college after completing my HSC through the CAP round. There is no special reason for me preferring this college as it was one of the preferences while I was filling my admission form and I got my name in this college in the first list itself. This college was offering facilities, infrastructure, atmosphere, and ofcourse, the course I needed so I preferred to block my seat here on the first go."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","Because of good infrastructure, historical achievements, and good placement ratio. The admission took by CAP round. The college has the best teaching facilities with well-equipped labs they have a great history of making good engineers. The college is rated with A++ remark is one of the reasons to choose this college."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","The college is very clean and hygienic, And the canteen good is very healthy, Teachers are friendly The negative remark is the college is still not maintained properly And the course curriculum should be renewed"
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",Maintaining the proper asset of an organisation is very much important Late Mohd Saboo Siddik Seth has developed this college and from those years it has been maintained with proper arrangements for parking and security
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","The atmosphere was good, Faculty were also good and did help us with our project works, placements etc. The college cam improve in the course structure, the lab works, a better playing area for refreshment and the placement scenario."
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",The college is good with placements and teaching and stuffs. The canteen is the biggest negative thing about the college. There is no cleanliness in the canteen and the food quality is also not good.
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",The college should work on placement because there is no meaning of having a good teaching staff if the deserving students will not get placed. The college should increase the extra curricular activities
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",No negative remarks for my college By Grace of God I have got my dream Institute so no negative remarks No problem for Parking Ample space for Parking and Campus is huge Canteen is good Library is well maintained All is good
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",Positive:- Labs are spacious and has latest equipments. Library has a good number of books. Convenient to travel from all three railway line. Located in heart of the city. Negative:- Canteen not good. No sport ground. Fest not that glitz and glamour.
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",College supports overall development of an individual. Its one the oldest college in mumbai which was developed in 1929.Overall experience of college is very good and anybody can apply for this college without any hesitation.
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",One thing I can say that regarding bad remarks about my college that college staff person were not doing their job as properly
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai",Pros are the faculties are good and that's it all depends on the student how they look at the college Cons infrastructure is in building phases hope it will get better soon gender ratio is 1:30 for mech Dept
"MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering, Mumbai","     ""College Infrastructure - Looks grand from the outside. The office and corridors are well maintained. Classrooms can be better Placement -Average placements Canteen -Probably competes for the worst canteen anywhere in the world. Library -Well furnished and equipped. Sports facilities -The sports events are great, but nothing much thereafter."""
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",     Infrastructure is amazing The overall crowd is good college fees is very high as compared to facilities provided the faculty is not so good and is one of the biggest problems canteen food is average attendance above 75 is compulsory placement is ok hygiene is horrible no place for sports college fest zephyr and tech zephyr is the best part
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",     College has excellent infrastructure and it is improving more and more year by year. Faculty should know how to teach and clear the doubts of students. Concepts should be taught in interesting way and every student's doubts must be clear. If it requires more lectures for it then be it but the core concepts should be well stored in student's minds and teachers should take this responsibility. Placements are not so good in LTCOE as TPO brings Non-IT companies for placements of IT students. Students diversity is a very good point in this college. College fees is very high as compared to facilities provided by the college.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     Faculty of a mechanical branch is good lab facilities are average,canteen food is ok college fest is amazing,some of the events are really good they mention gymkhana in college magazine every year,but there is no such gymkhana in the college."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     The faculty is good and always there for students.Recently there is the improvement in infrastructure.College host annual tech and cultural fest some department have their own tech fest.Many student clubs are also there in college.The office staff is the worst they never listen to anybody and no concern shown to a student.College fees are also very high but there are no facilities. There is no playground. In canteen also there is no place to sit.And placement is the worst.At the end, i can say that its an average college with average college life."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",     Good college and has all basic amenities.faculty is good.placement as such is not up to the mark.student crowd is also decent but on the other hand has no.such great college life.there is no room for sports but is developing.there are various clubs in the college.college also goes for inter-college competitions.industrial visits are conducted for every branch every year.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",     A good college to pursue your bachelor's degree in Mumbai. Facilities provided are okay types. Recreational activities are a plus point. Many competitions are organized throughout the year with a cultural and technical fest called 'Zephyr'. College conducts training programs for final year students which are helpful in aptitude tests. Overall a recommended college to take admission in.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",     This is the best college if you want to enjoy the college life. The college has very good infrastructure and facilities for students as well as faculty. I really enjoy the FEST conducted in this college and the FASHION show is just amazing. Faculties of this college are good and the Principal is just too cool and supporting person. He always boosts the morale of students. Sports is another area to look out for in this college. They have a very good sports team. So I strongly recommend this college to all the students.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     One of the numerous below par institutions offering technical education, LTCE endows upon its graduates a degree that neither offers adequate classroom knowledge of undertaken course nor employer valued current industry exposure, its only saving grace being its accreditation from Mumbai University. Potential enrolls are advised to make an informed career choice rather than just follow the herd."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     1) This is my graduation college and as far one of the best college for mechanical engineering students in Navi Mumbai. 2) The college has best infrastructure for all the departments ie mechanical,computer,electrical,electronics etc. 3) The faculties are the best teachers for mechanical department. 4) But the college lacks to give industrial exposure and placement to the students but they are surely improving on it. 5) The college has also a good library to help them in the curriculum. 6) Last but not at least a value for money college as far as my mechanical department is concerned."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     The cultural festival of Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, 'Zephyr', is hosted sometime in March, and the technical festival 'Techzephyr' is hosted around September.Hygiene isn’t great, but that really shouldn’t be of much concern for engineering students.An amazing infrastructure does not make an amazing college."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     Like most colleges in the outskirts, Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering (LTCE) doesn’t exactly attract the best crowd. While its not bad, the majority of people come from Vashi, Thane and Koparkhairane. It’s a fairly mixed crowd though. Acceptable."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     A Nightmare for College students is here......""UNIFORMS"".....a compulsion...!!! If afraid of being ragged in other colleges, better join LTCE....quite strict about ragging....not good college but if u don't hav option then ok...the waste college ever i have seen.......full y corrupted...... .the fees is not even half the worth...."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     Very unhygienic place..canteen on basement which is dirty... No waters in washroom ...leakage and dirty washrooms... Practice building is ok... no campus at all now ....basket ball court without basket..... dirty washrooms... no one to clean washrooms.... Faculty are ok ...Please visit both the buildings ,washroom, and canteen before admission or else.. you will cry"
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     There have tiny changes in the infrastructure recently, washrooms have turned worse and so have the classrooms. Until the construction work completed students will have to face difficulties and that's gonna a year or two more.EXTC department rocks!! But you will have to face many problems if u missed any important things like submissions or tests, etc. But after all the best branch of LT is EXTC"
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",     Faculties here trouble u a lot especially in second year..!! Many rude brats hangin around..! But a decent college if u don't hav any options... They are real strict about the attendance here..!! This is why students are forced to sit in class and study.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     Last possible option if u can't get in better ones. Mechanical department is probably amongst best in Navi Mumbai, though with decent placements & even comps. If u want a hip life, cool friends , great hangouts and decent extracurriculars , this ain't the place to be! Pretty depressing social life here "
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",     The electrical department is the worst here. Now even the infra structure is lagging. We have so many more restrictions placed on our head by the college. The labs in the 1st year comps department and mechanical department are good while the remainder suffer with non functioning equipment.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     Fees are high... no other colleges has this much fees especialy in SE... approx 1,13,000... poor facilities.... no gymkhana.... no ground.... poor canteen.... all fests are dumb.... only students of mech should join this college... EXTC is worst...."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     Really awesome college. Superb infrastructure, experienced faculty, well equipped labs, a massive library and even placements above 75%!! What more we require? It is surely a competing college for KJ Somaiya, Vidyalankar, Vivekananda, etc. Mechanical Engineering department is best here and some even say that its better compared to Datta Meghe and Father Angel."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     1,00,000+ fees, No Gymkhana, No ground, Non-hygienic canteen, None of the lift works except exam time, college takes money for gymkhana + college i-cards and so on, doesn't issues cards and there isn't any gymkhana at all... None of the equipments of the labs work... EXTC is worst... This college is only money making collge..."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     The college has canteen but there is no seating arrangement, the college has lift but none of them are working, so many washrooms but none of them are cleaned and maintained, NO GROUND, NO SPORTS ROOM and we have to PAY Rs 1,13,000 for such nonsense."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     I study in this college... This is the worst college of engg I have ever seen in Maharashtra... it does not have proper washrooms and fans does not work... and you can't identify whether it's Gents or Ladies Toilet... it does has not have gym, khanna, playground... college only puts money in pocket... it does not have facility at all..."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     Probably the only college in India which charges you a ludicrous 500 bucks for issuing an ID card. I am repenting to this day for joining this college. Well to put it in few words, it is more of a 'money laundering scheme' and less of a college. Classrooms leak during monsoons.Admini stration is not up to the mark."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",     No placements in college. Faculty and tpo are not supportive. They do what they want. Office and exam staff is very rude in nature. Non-working instruments are more in every lab. But fee is expensive. Please do not select this college for your egg.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",     1st of all one should not do Engg.But unfortunately if u wanna do Engg don't go with this short college.Its the worst college .Worst management .They just want donations from student.And the faculties are like who the hell r they and how they became a teacher.Worst management worst teaching faculty.Whatever will be the college whoever be the faculties but if u r getting a good placement through the college the college is best.and for us what is this placement....???accha aisa b much hota h kya??the college having worst placement and worst campus.A shitt is very valuebLe than getting admission in this college
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",College management only cares about the money. In conclusion don't take admission in my college. Plz try other private colleges and even there take detailed review from a former student.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",Although College is good. Placement is not up to mark. Faculties are cooperative.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",Lokmanya tilak college of engineering well i can them good remark. and our college management staff are also helpful. never trouble us well from my side i will give them a good remark.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",Overall I love my college very much. The college staff & management are very good & help in every way possible. I don't have any negative remarks except for the restriction of college management on the college grounds & canteen during lecture hrs. Also low attendance to classes is frowned upon.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",I want to pursue my career in Electrical and power related field. My college has ranked in one of the best colleges in Mumbai for Electrical engineering. So I choose this college. The college has very good Placements. My college organizes Various Fest and National level Competitions in Electrical field.The faculty of professers are Excellent.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",College management is good well I had not face anything bad remarks during academic year.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",Yes the college is nice but I think they should bring more and more companies to our college which will give our students more opportunity to perform their talent in front of companies and get the job which will be very very beneficial for our students
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",1)College should focous on actual industrial visits. 2) they should allow students for atleast 6 months of internship 3) college should focus on more practical knowledge other than theoretical knowledge.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",College focus on progress of all students and for there better future. But not able to change there conventional methods of teaching. Students are altogether great crowd to be with but some of them are not serious about there career and try to distract you.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",The college is best for engineering in Navi Mumbai area. So if you are the citizens of Navi Mumbai or near area and wanted to do engineering then this is the best college. But the only thing is that mess food is little bit expansive.
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","Our college is good at some points where they deserve a positive remark but even can get negative remark at the same time. But still, the institution and the trust are responsible for this not the students. So I believe that students should be the face of the college not the trust."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","College have a small campus I thing is a negative remark and it have small ground, and positive point is that it have best and free environment teachers are the best part of college and this college is full fill of events"
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","infrastructure is good but it could get better if they connect all the buildings like architecture, school, engg college tigether so yhat the campus becomes a bit big and a good place . some teachers need to improve ther teaching skills"
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","There should be a proper playing ground of college. The fees should be not this much expensive, as the fee structure you can see is very costly. Many extra charges have been made in the fee structure."
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",No there are no negative remarks about the college it is a great experience been getting from college and it is a good place and we get good knowledge from everywhere and had enjoyed my college life in a positive way
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",Overall my experience being here since last three years seems to be good enough. Basically the college infrastructure seem to be well maintained. Highly satisfied being here
"Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",Overall the College is good in terms of good education.Although the placement is not that much up to date.The faculties are very supportive.
"Smt Indira Gandhi College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",     It is a very decent college for average background students. Mechanical branch is rated with A grand course. Canteen is decent.

"Smt Indira Gandhi College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",     The Faculty of the college is good but the placement is not provided. Canteen and playground facilities are improved now. As college has shifted to Ghansoli the overall infrastructure of college is best. College is best and doesn't worry about jobs. The staff is much more helpful and lectures are best by most of the faculties.
"Smt Indira Gandhi College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",     College infrastructure is quite poor. The campus is very small. Student crowd is average. Affordability vice its good option. There is no auditorium so companies can not come on campus. College life is decent. If you have a good crowd in your batch then it will be a good experience but from college side input is quite poor.
"Smt Indira Gandhi College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",     As per my experience i would suggest not to do any stream of engineering from this college. The sole purpose of doing engineering from this college can only be getting Engineering degree from Mumbai university. The fees structure is comparatively less as compared to near by colleges but return of investment is quite poor.
"Smt Indira Gandhi College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","     College is not that great, infrastructure is below average, teaching faculty is mostly good and are very helpful.

"Smt Indira Gandhi College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",     The college has Wi-Fi facility throughout the campus.

Its not college with big lobbys to walk by and sit in groups . You will feel like some residential building with some classrooms. TSEC has many events throughtout the year. If you are part of some committee then its good for you else, your wasting your college time. It has best placements with average faculty. Students of IT dept find difficult to bunk lectures, whereas, other department students can bunk easily. Fees is too high!"
"Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Mumbai","     Although infrastructure is not good, the locality and crowd makes up for it. Not very study oriented but good placements make up for it.

Just like many other colleges in the city of Mumbai, TSEC, too, doesn't have any sprawling campus. Attendance is not a very big issue at Thadomal Shahani but they do stress on it sometimes. So one needs to be thoda attentive and pay heed to warnings, if any, just for the sake of it. Thadomal Shahani Engineering College (TSEC) has a 50% minority quota for Sindhis, so the cream crowd is very much expected. Decent people from good families are expected here.

No matter whether we win the competition or not, but they used to tell us participation is very important. They were very supportive and encouraged us in all things to grow up in our life's. We used to crack jokes on others. We used to comment on others. We used to bunk the class. We used to jump the walls for second show movies. If we caught by sir's we led to punishing.

There are immense numbers of extracurricular activities which a student can take part in apart from just going to college and studying. The faculty is good to a certain extent and also approachable. Placements are good.
"Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Mumbai",     This is the worst College you can ever experience. The faculty is extremely rude and full of attitude. They cannot teach and cannot communicate with the students politely. They have made my life a living hell and just cannot wait to leave this college. They won't let you sit for the exams if your attendance is less than 75%. They will fear you of giving a drop at least 7 times a day. It is absolutely a nightmare being in this college.
"Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Mumbai","     College is really excellent in terms of extra curriculum activities and in terms of people and location where it is located, people here are happy and chilled, infrastructure has become bit old but you will find all the comforts here except lecture halls,faculty varies by departments some departments are cool with everything while some departments get up to your nerves,placements here have grown every year with interesting packages, 80% crowd is Sindhi while other 20% have come on their merits, go for it if you want to have good career along with fun with your engineering period."

You can sit for 2 companies."

"Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Mumbai",All over it's a decent college if you dont get into any NITs. Since the city place the role any college here is managable. Negative thing about the college is infrastructure and canteen. The food served is not made in hygenic place

Strongest point of this college is their academics. This college is one of the very few who actually think about learning science and personality development of the student. Although sometimes it may seem tedious to follow their schedule, but, believe me, it will be worth when you will be sitting for a job or decide to do something different. Under the guidance of one of the coolest principal, this college is improving by leaps and bounds."

"Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai","    SPIT, one of the renowned engineering colleges in Mumbai, the college where I happen to be doing my engineering too. For me, this campus is more than what it stands for. After spending merely six months as a student of this institution, I have everything I could have ever asked for. Because it's more than a college campus. This is a place where I'm learning, and not studying. I'm learning things that will actually matter ten years down the line. There's more than rote learning studying here. There are people here, not just the students but the teachers too, who have positively impacted my life. And yes, the friends that I've made, they are going to be for more than the 4 years of engineering.SPIT is larger than the educational institution it is. This is the place where they teach you not only how to learn but also how to handle the ropes of life."
"Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai","     Sardar Patel institute of technology (or spit). It's the prism and the students, the incident light rays. It brings out all the colours of everyone who passes through it. And although it keeps our noses so close to the books that they are rubbed raw, it does give us the scent of the pages and allows us to explore and expand our own potential. The all round approach to the students welfare is seen here. The udaan, the space, the clubs, the freshers. The seniors, here, always encouraging and supportive, the principal, always ready to see to the classes, the teachers, working hard as hell to keep up spit's fame and status. Spit makes sure that these 4 yrs are the best years of every student's life."
"Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai",    Compromised sizes(you will never use the full 47 acres of the campus) and facilities in gymkhana(Just a little room) and playground. Relatively better placements backed by wide opportunities to explore the corporate world. Wonderful library. And every good college like this one has a hectic and busy schedule so there is not much choice left in that area.
"Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai","     Located in an inaccessible part of the suburbs, the college still manages to pull the brightest minds in the city. If you are unable to get into IITs, NITs, this college might be a decent choice. Pros- Good Placements and almost 100% placement. Decent Infrastructure and a huge campus. Cons- lack of hostels, have to maintain a good attendance. The crowd is primarily nerdy, but a bunch of cream crowd is expected."
"Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai","     Located in suburbs, considered as 1 of the best colleges in the state.

"Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai",    Good people to hang out around. The crowd is competitive and provides room for development.

Too many assignments to do and continuous tests are a bit too hectic.
"Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai","     Seniors are helpful. Fests are fun. Good corporate exposure. A lot of extracurricular activities. Lots of stupid submissions, though. Attendance is a big issue. College schedule teaches you time management big time. Very hectic college schedule. teaching quality not that good."
"Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai","    The best of city lads get admission here, but they are just like any of your school friends with whom you have done crazy and stupid stuff. But you can still survive here, it takes some more active neurons, that's it. One great advantage is you can be anything you want to be. There is a lot of flexibility in student programs and events. Students take an initiative to do many good things themselves and there are least hurdles to clear it. Though teachers are not up to the mark, they neither are a pain if you are doing something innovative, knowledge and talent are respected."
"Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai","    The people you are surrounded with in this college are amazing. A perfect environment to grow and develop yourself.

"Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai","    SPIT provides a very nurturing and friendly environment with great opportunities for an individual to develop and grow professionally. The faculty is very good, helping the students in every possible way possible. The infrastructure is pretty decent. If corporate world is what your target is, then SPIT is probably the best place to be in. The college ensures overall development of and individual by giving opportunities in every field possible. However, if you're looking for a technical profile, you might face a little difficulty in the beginning as many opportunities come your way. The committees (ecell, ieee, etc) in the college helps you to develop your corporate profile by providing you with the opportunities needed for it."

In a nutshell , our college is one of the best colleges you can get into."
"Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai",    The best thing about this college is that soon we'll be getting autonomy and well enter the league of colleges such as VJTI and IIT-B.

"Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai",Placement is the main factor I chose this college. This year there was a vast increase in the product based companies visiting our campus. It is ranked among the top 3 engineering colleges of Mumbai.Also average salary offered here is high.
"Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai",The college used have its own canteen but it was recently closed due to intimation from fire and health department. So one needs to go to outside the campus for food. One can also go to the SPCE canteen or SPJIMR canteen in case you need a mess.

"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","    XIE offers B.E. in three fields - Information Technology, Computer Engineering and Electronics & Telecommunications Engineering. Also, each stream has 60 students intake every year. I would like to say that the infrastructure of the labs and library are good, equipped with latest devices and very well renovated. There are separate laboratories for each subject and for each field."
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai",    Xavier's college is a nice college with huge campus and grounds for various activity. The college has a good participation in sports and cultural activities. The college has its own festival spend and transmission which are very popular and interesting. The college crowd is very nice. The faculty is just awesome and helpful. The college is very hygienic and clean. The college canteen is also.nice awesome.

There is the great encouragement of sports and cultural activities by the college principal, staff members and all other committee members.the college life is interesting and of great fun. The surrounding atmosphere is perfect for studying."
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","   The principal has started the system of sending letters at home and threatens to detain students who bunk regularly. As long as you keep it above 70% there should be no problems. Regarding hangouts, there is nothing much in Mahim so the students usually head to Bandra which is nearby. Innumerable places to go once you reach Bandra."
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai",    The infrastructure Xavier Institute of Engineering is not very satisfactory. The college ground is big enough to play all sports. Majority of the lab equipment's work properly. Classrooms are in decent condition. Libraries have desired number of books. Lack of lush green plantations is a big thumbs down to such a huge campus.
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai",    Xavier Engineering College is definitely not your first choice but it is a better option than the colleges which are far away from Mumbai if you don’t manage to get into the top colleges. Most of the teachers at Xavier Institute of Engineering (XIE) are good but there are a few horrible exceptions. The fresh graduates who have taken up teaching are really pathetic. The best faculty is in EXTC and IT departments.
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","   60% of the students get placed. Tech Mahindra takes maximum students. Patni, Infosys, Accenture and Quinox are the other major companies. The placements and salaries offered are just about average. Panasonic recruited a student from EXTC and offered 12 lakh p.a.. Hope it's true."
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","    The placement situation is improved now.This year on wards TCS, accenture, Infosys and Panasonic have started recruiting students. Panasonic offered 1 from EXTC student 12 lacs package to work in Dubai. Also Spandan n Transmission don't happen alternate years...They both happen every year... :)"
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","    its got d perfect blend of studies , discipline , sports and tons of fun. teachers are cooperative. teaching methodology is nice. regular assignments and tests keep you in pace with approaching semester exams. you get acknowledgement s for any type of co curricular activities. seniors have always been friendly and helpful. lots of sporting activities to show your field mettle."
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","    Oscar Wilde after seeing the 3 story Xavier Institute of Engineering- 'Never knew shit could pile up so high.' Truth be told, this college is not the best way to spend your 4(or more) Engineering years. Reasons being: 1. Attendance is strict as hell. 2. The area sucks. 3. The canteen serves jail food. 4. Average campus 5. The crowd is really really average. Feels like the weight of the world before you graduate. Convocation=sal vation from this God forsaken Guantanamo of a place"
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","    Principal (well I don't really feel like talking about him. It lowers my dignity). Most of the times when you enter the college, you feel like you have come for a wedding. You have a plus point here. You can have dinner for free if you want. Talking of festivals, they are OK except for some restrictions from management. Placement is OK compared to quality of teaching. I give this college 1 star out of 5 star. Don't try to make this college as your option unless you have done very bad in entrance exams."
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","The college is ranked 3rd among private colleges in Mumbai by Times of India.It has good infrastructure,lot of labs and a lot of companies come for placements.The faculty is also good and very helpful."
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai",There are multiple factors which made me choose this college.1- the college ranks 4th all over Mumbai.2- the college provides 100% placement 3- the quality of teaching is very good and teachers are well reputed.4- college focuses on both technical as well as cultural development.5- the college provides an environment of growth.
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai",Staff is very good and helpful. The main negative thing is that ther vicinity is very poorly managed we dont have that many shops near by as it is situated in mahim. Canteen needs improvement. Canteen is shitty in our college we dont have space to sit outside seatings are not clean and food is not that good.
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","At first, you will hate the college. I specially hated the college canteen. But yeah. College koi bhi ho, sab gaaliya dete hai. Dost acche banao, memories banao and give your best. I missed alot of these things."
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","Positive, great environment to study and grow All over more than a medium level college with decent placement records and good student crowd , students come from different parts of Maharashtra to achieve their dreams."
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai",Positive are all mentioned throughout the form Also to mention they really keep the college clean and many trees around the institute which gives nice vibes. Negative can be attendance issue which is actually not enforced by institute but by Mumbai University to which we are affiliated
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","only the gymkhana is not properly managed and no kits are properly there in the place. and about the placements, it's very excellent and very nice. most of the companies come to our campus and they take most of the students."
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","The college is ranked 3rd among private colleges in Mumbai by Times of India.It has good infrastructure,lot of labs and a lot of companies come for placements.The faculty is also good and very helpful."
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai",Very good college ranks 3rd In Mumbai among all the negative feedback no negative feedback the only negative feed back is the librarian and in tea they put a lot of water 200 characters why so much ?
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai",College management was good and supportive overall good and enjoyed our college life.
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai",The college life was mostly chilled and had a overall good experience in this college.
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai",Teaching staff is really good. Infrastructure wise need to improve.
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","Overall my college is a place where i experienced many things faced many problems,learned how to solve those problems,met many poeple. Faced hardship with some teachers but this experience made me so strong to face the outside world. So all the work we did at our college all the problems we had in turn made me more stronger. So i would say that the management of college is really good. Its how it has to be."
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","College management sometimes pay too much attention to only studies rather extra-curricular activities. But they are helpful at the end, However if you encounter the Admins you will find that all they talk about is scoring in exams and studies and not care so much about student bodies or extra curriculars.However the director, Father Francis is the best and most supportive for all the things and helps students a lot"
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","Because i always wanted to get admission in TFWS seat.When i was filling my form to get admission, i applied all College for TFWS.then luckily I got admission in Xavier with TFWS.And i wanted to get in IT department so i got it."
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai",The college is very good and very well organized.
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","The teachers are the best thing about XIE, they punish and scold you but also give you term marks. For our batch they made special greeting cards for everyone. We have a big ground for Cricket and Football. Two big Workshops for technical activities."
"Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mumbai","    This college rocks as long as you mind your own business. 3rd class staff (especially teaching staff). Library is not at all a favorable place to sit and study (thanks to the mosquitoes). During exams you will get to enjoy Koli music and dance quite often. Don't ever try to eat in the canteen, you'll most probably meet fried cockroach someday. You better go and eat in the next lane."
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",    Nice college. Pretty average though. Most of the time the college is totally empty. I have hardly seen any seniors in my time in XIE. Staff has BMC mentality. Attendance is very strict and teaching is average. If u have 130+ in MH-CET please don't opt for this college
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","    Vidyalankar Institute of Technology (VIT) shares the campus with Vidyalankar Polytechnic and Vidyalankar School of Information Technology. The campus comprises 3 buildings, 2 gardens, a football field, a volleyball ground and also a cricket pitch. Placements at Vidyalankar are quite decent, mainly because of the contacts the college administration has within the industry.A canteen and a cafe both offer a wide range of food and beverages. Food is edible and moderately cheap."
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",    VIT has one of the best faculties in mu. Their electronic labs are very well equipped. They provide us with good study materials. They also carry out various programmes like eyantra: a robotic competition in which I too had taken part and it was a good experience because I gained ample amount of knowledge from it. VIT is best known for its infrastructure. I have also made a good group of friends with whom I not only have fun but also study. In short I am lucky enough to be in VIT.
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",    My college life in VIT is much better than my junior college life . The infrastructure is awesome it looks like a mall. classrooms are big and spacious. Faculty is very good and complete all the syllabus. Canteen provides good food but the cost is very high... If u are a bright student placement is guaranteed but no. if companies coming are less.
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","    Happy to be part of such college, amazing infrastructure, super awesome faculty, and all other events organized in college are very well organized best college. We are being well trained by are mentors for our career and different seminars by different expertises are also arranged."
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","    Vidyalankar has a nice campus and excellent faculty who are highly qualified. Our classrooms have AC. So, no problem in summers.

"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",    Talking about studies The faculty is really nice they help so much their efforts are there. Then labs are maintained. Nice equipment. The fest is fun here. Then sports n all is there. Infrastructure looks like Mall. Nice n big canteen. Enjoyable life on this campus.
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","    Although situated in a relatively repulsive area, once you enter the gates, Vidyalankar Institue of Technology boasts an excellent infrastructure and a diminutive but decent-looking campus. Apart from the locality and the accessibility, shortcomings about the college, per se, are pretty hard to spot. The laboratories have state of the art equipment and the library offers a myriad of books, both old and new. The professors, like in every other college, are diverse; some good and some a tad below par. The crowd is heterogeneous, yet affable; the seniors, too, are very obliging. There are two canteens that serve fairly average food. The college does not provide any sort of accommodation for OHU students."
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","    I have had a great experience with his college, I personally feel that college must be secondary it's up to individuals interest on how you perform during your graduation and very less it depends on the college. So if you are a good learner VIT would not be a bad option."
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","    VIT is a college which will help in your all round development. The infrastructure of the college is excellent while the faculty, canteen, placements are decent. The has good transportation from Wadala as well as Dadar stations. The crowd of the college is decent but there are very few places to hang out outside the college."
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",    Here education quality is really great. The crowd is great and people come from really good places. The college is in the best locations of Mumbai. The food quality of canteen is also hygienic and also there are many places in Mumbai where you can hang out around after college. There is a safety for students in the college. Faculty members are good and helpful. You will really end up in a good company.
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","    It has one of the best architecture which makes you feel very comfortable(P.S. all classrooms, as well as computer labs, are air conditioned ). Helpful faculty & non-teaching staff makes your routine easy. Renowned companies visit the campus for placement. Hosts one of the best college annual festivals call VERVE in which you can take part in any committee you want to.Has lots of Technical and also Non-technical committees which help you to grow as a team member as well as an individual. Overall a great place to be."
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","    The campus can be compared to a mall, the teaching staff is friendly and approachable, a non-teaching staff is exactly opposite. The campus is wifi enabled but the connection sometimes is negligible. The college has a good crowd. Teaching is also very good. Libraries are really good. No four wheeler parking for students. The area surrounding the college is really shady. College will train you for your placement interviews. The auditorium is really good. The kits in the labs are sometimes in a bad shape but you can live with them."
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",    Faculty of this college is nice .infrastructure is the best placements are good. Canteen of this college is also good. Good library. Teachers are friendly . Labs are also good . Cleaning is also proper. Overall best college.hostels are quite far from the college.Nonteaching faculty is also helpful
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",    Best infrastructure as compared to any other colleges of Mumbai. Good placements. Good crowd. No attendance compulsion and experienced lecturers. You can enjoy four years of your life along with studying. Good for pursuing MS and also good internship opportunities 
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","    The best college faculty ,good infrastructure good crowd and affordable Canteen is good Life in this college is best and really great experience Every week there is new workshop or conference and etc Gymkhana is best place to play with your friends Teachers teaching is nest as they use ppt presentation and quiz for every subject Department takes feedback for them n they take it in positive way so no teacher does partiality Overall the college is really awesome be sure with vidyalankar!!!!!!!"
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",    College infrastructure is just like awesome.collage always take a responsibility of students involvement in each n every activity conducted by the different student council.The professors in the college are very experienced people they give u a deep knowledge about the subject conceptually.
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",    Abhorrent. Mostly egotistical faculty knowing nothing beyond their own BE or ME probably done from here and working here because anywhere else they won't get value. Everyone behaves like they own students. Extracurricular activities are squashed. Director is far too happy with mass recruitment. Important tools like github are considered hyped up shit here.
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","      The campus is superb, faculty top class very helpful, notes are also very student friendly.good placement record.two libraries where all books are available reading room is there. The whole campus is fully AC and wifi is also there. Very great atmosphere.   "
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",      Academic wise its a good college to opt for. There are professors who look forward to teach in a way which is easy for students to understand and they also complete the entire syllabus. Library facility is good. Food available in the canteen is bit costly.VERVE our cultural fest is what you can enjoy. The classrooms are spacious and air-conditioned. There are projector and LCDs also available during teaching. The average package got by students here is around 3- 4 Lakh per annum. Few of the students do manage to bag bigger and very high paying offers too.   
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","      Vidyalankar has got amazing infrastructure. Though college is placed in bit slum area but inside our college you will get healthy environment! The college has proper cleaning systems, well maintained washrooms, water purifiers. We have all AC classrooms. All faculty members are so friendly with students. They do help people and students are very enthusiastic to do their work! Our student council is also very much helpful. They arrange events every Friday and Saturday so that people can learn new things! Better response has got from students to these events!! Companies like TCS,  L&T places our students with satisfactory packages.So overall it's a great college.   "
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","      This is my second year in this institute and so far it has been very good. Teachers teach with great effort. Infrastructure is very classy. The college has maintained a good ground but you need to take permission from sports secretary if you want to play on the ground. We have the print in our college so that we take printout in the college and we need not roam out for the print. Vidyalakar live is very useful, it is just like a social networking site where we can discuss, the teachers can share experiments and assignments. Soon vidyalankar is going to get nba accredit ion which would be very beneficial for the institute the students.   "
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","      I have been in Vidyalankar Institute of technology for more than 1.5 years and the experience has been great. I love the infrastructure. It is better than most of the other colleges. I have been to and I have been to quite a few good ones. At first, look the college looks like a 4-star hotel. It has a life-size chess, an Amphitheatre and an award-winning Auditorium.All the classrooms are Air-Conditioned. One of the important utility for students is VPrint which allows students take printouts at the nominal cost.The cleanliness inside the college is worth talking about. You won't see even a single piece of paper lying in the corridor. This is the joint effort of the cleaning staff, students and teachers.Now talking about the ambiance, the college is surrounded like a peninsula by a not-so-good area (a slum actually) Sangam Nagar. Dosti Acres, the famous towers is walking distance from the college. There is a Coffee Day Xpress(CDX) inside the college. Some of hanging out points near college include Dosti Acres, Five Gardens and Big Cinema IMAX is also nearby.VERVE - the college festival has tons of activities spread over glorious 3 days. The Events include Technical events like Lazer Maze and Lazer Tag and non-Technical Events like Creative Writing etc.So that's all about my experience great Vidyalankar Institute of Technology.   "
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","      Amongst all Mumbai university colleges, my college is one of the best in infrastructure and campus placements and moreover the faculty os also very nice and co-operative.The hostel is a bit far from the college but it is very nice and neat. It also has a very nice ambience for studies.There are iPads provided in the libraries and very nice and affordable canteen.   "
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",      Has this college provide their students a good quality of training and development courses. Faculty are welled experience in their field. This college provides many a knowledge and experience activity in every one. College campus is best from others college.   
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","      If you have ever been to Vidyalankar Institute of technology, your first impression would be whether I am in a mall, there is no parallel to any engineering college in mumbai and not just outside the classrooms inside are no less epic. I had the good fortune of not only being a student here but being on other side as a faculty for a short stint post college. The values I gained in this college and friends I made have made this one helll of an educational trip   "
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","      Infrastructure is very good but the surrounding area of the college is a big problem .While studies are well taken care of by the excellent faculties (one doesn't need to join classes) ,extra curricular activities are almost nothing compared to other colleges with similar CET cutoffs.Placements again are nothing to what it should be for a college with such infrastructure and faculty. No dream company visits the institute. 3-4 mass recruiting companies visit (mass recruitment ~35-45students /company).Again very less compared to other colleges and only IT companies visit.   "
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","      Spent 4 years of my life here. Faculty used to be top notch, some of the best profs in Mumbai used to teach here which was the USP of the college. However the faculty quality has deteriorated. But the college infrastructure has improved every year since. Even though the college is not located in a particularly attractive area i.e. Sangam Nagar, it nonetheless  makes up for it with the campus life. Something or the other keeps happening there everyday. And the new management block that has been built...simply WOW! Placements are one thing which could drastically improve in the future and be better managed. But that's the case with most of the engineering colleges. The cultural fest and tech fest are two of the most eagerly anticipated events here. The cafeteria has a wide range of foods..from burgers and pastries to dosas, rolls and maggie. A new CCD store had also opened opposite the football ground.Coming to the sports facilities...there is a sports room which has all the sports equipment and where if you go you'll definitely find someone or the other playing TT or Carom. There are two grounds which are used for either cricket or football alternatively.  The college is not that strict about attendance...although a minimum 75% is required. Some faculties might be a more strict in that regards...however in the end everything is managed. You'll get a mixed crowd here..from the super rich to the middle class and not so affluent people...people from SoBo to Thane! Senior Junior interaction is a bit less, however the friends you make here will be friends for life. In short you'll have an awesome 4 years of your life here!   "
"Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",      excellent infrastructure good support staff excellent faculty the college has state of art labs for all the verticals the college provides holistic development and has decent placements the higest package at our  time was 30 lakhs pa which only collages like iit can boast of all in all one of the better colleges affiliated to Mumbai university

"KC College of Engineering and Management Studies and Research, Thane","Infra is good and excellent canteen facility. Placements : Good placements. Don't have worry about if you have a decent CGPA.

"KC College of Engineering and Management Studies and Research, Thane","     in this University, students are taught how to earn the best job by hard and disciplined work. Students got more than one job offer on average, with some students getting 6, some students getting 5, some getting 4 job offers etc. The highest package went above Rs 10 lakhs per annum. Many students got job offers of Rs 9 lakhs per annum The infrastructure is suited to the needs to developing a student as a maker. University does not provide high end readymade high valued kits to work upon, but provides all infrastructure via which you can build and learn. Students are motivated to design and develop, and as a result the infrastructure contains high end equipments now, which have been developed by students like mini-CNC machine, 3-D printer, which are itself sellable products. University funds it's students to register their own company and sell these products Teachers are extremely helpful. They do not spoonfeed, but open the window for the students to learn, and develop themselves into makers. Many faculty members have themselves worked in industries in the past and hence can give the real insight of how work is done in industry. During exams they take special classes to help you build, but once again the discussions are never question answer oriented, it is oriented towards developing yourself, which will help you earn a good job Lot of events are held, which the students are given the complete responsibility to organise like Science exhibitions, entrepreneurship weeks, international conferences, technical festivals, job fairs, cultural festivals, celebration of science week etc Highly good impression about the University"

If compared with top institutes it comes around the top 5 colleges for commerce. The bad aspect is the size of the college, it's really compact.

"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",     College campus is very good but there is no proper ground. There are CCTV cameras all over the college. Labs are also well maintained with working experimental setup. The college has good workshops. Chemical faculties are interactive but not that much helpful
"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     Everything is just as ordinary as it could have been. Expected more from the college but didn't get, most of the faculties don't know the proper way to teach, they need some training on how to teach, rest of the thing is that our future depends on ourselves, on how we perform ourselves and work hard, hence needed internships"
"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","     This is a good college beneficial only if you are hard-working, dedicated and motivated.

"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","College is good, faculties are okay placements are assured by principal and if you work hard u will get one. But thinking and preparing for off campus placements. College management is not too good but it will surly improve with time. Students and faculties both are working hard for this"
"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",In my opinion college is good for my overall engineering experience. College management is good and every department has AC computer labs with all the necessary facilities.
"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",As mentioned a very good place for education and also a good platform to showcase aur abilities. The campus is good. Also the class rooms are well maintained. A positive point about location is it is near from kharghar railway station. We do not need any transportation facility from station.
"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",The college's suits them who are working along with their studies. It is not very demanding in general but it also depends upon person to person.one may feel bored if they are only concentrated on their college life. Not a happening college life here.
"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","If we talk about the engineering department, the college are is very small. We have architecture and dental college too, but space wise the engineering college is very small. The benches in every class are not at all maintained. All the labs are air-conditioned and well-maintained. The college is neat and clean, and you will see greenery everywhere. The infrastructure of the building is okay, the colour is maintained. The playing ground is not at all maintained."
"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",Just a good College with good infrastructure but there is scope for improvement in various sections. Facilities need to improved. Staff quality. Machines and instruments quality. Specially placement need to be more aggresive.

"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","The college is overall balanced and maintained with proper infrastructure, security and it feels like a home."
"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",As there are two side of coin. So there are some negative parts in the college that it's is too far from the main city and the campus is overcrowded with unknown people they allow everyone in the college campus
"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai","our college is overall good in every department. Improvement of technical knowledge, extra curricular activites, events and sports activites everything is there but 75 % attendence is compulsory in our college canteen infrastructure need to be more better these two are negative point i think."
"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",College management is not good as much as we expect and the worst part of college is the canteen which should be totally replaced. If you see that once you will never go there.
"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",There are various scholarship. One of them is e-scholarship. It is annualy implemented. Consisting of reducing. They don't neeed to get money anymore. They have earned enough for lifetime. So good package we have. The fee structure is feasible. Fee structure is affordable.

"Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai",College is overall good for a student scoring between 100-130 in mhcet. It will be surely a great platform for learners. Bvcoe also stands among top 50 private engineering college so it's great to be in.

"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",     The college labs are good and in working conditions. Thr faculties are very good and supportive and crowd is not so good. It has good fests and supportive teachers. The canteen are is the best place but there is no variety in food. For studying this college is very good.
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","     The college has no good placements, and 75% attendance is compulsory. The college is average. Placements: I would say that the placements are average, and they try to place you in non-engineering profiles. The average salary offered is 12-15K per month. They don't offer internships, and they tell you to get it on your own. Around, 20% of the students got a place in engineering profiles. They keep job fair and rarely anyone is placed in it. Infrastructure: The classrooms are spacious. The lab needs more advanced equipment on the campus. The canteen looks great, but the food is average. There's no ground to play. There is no hostel. There is no A/C in the classrooms and labs. If you're a sports player, then this is not a college for you. The parking is good, and the gym is small. Faculty: The teachers are well-qualified, knowledgeable, and not helpful. The teaching is good in the EXTC branch. There are different teachers for practical and theory. There is no industry exposure. Around, 75% attendance is compulsory, and you'll get detained if your attendance is less. You cannot do a lot of other stuff as you always have to maintain your attendance. Other: Only one big fest named 'Nakshatra' and some small 2 to 3 events are held on the campus. There is only government recommended scholarships like EBC, OBC, SC, ST, and nothing else. The campus crowd is average. They provide bus facility from a railway station. There are 2 to 3 workshops related to your branch. There are a few sports activities."
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","     This college is good. Staff of my department is very supportive. They helps in every activity. Right from studies to sports, you will find everyone support. Lot of motivation to participate in other activities. Entrepreneur development cell. I strongly recommend this college"

The college council, brings you some great social and cultural events, so that throughout the year you can enjoy, faculties are good enough, canteen has been changed now. Crowd is actually good, as most of the students are enthusiast. Yes, there's always a trip in a year to somewhere, with the notation of industrial visit . So, overall, the college is worth if you want to study as well as enjoy your engineering days."
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","     Excellent! Saraswati College of Engineering (SCoE) is spread out over 11 acres. Classrooms are spacious and labs are well-equipped. Centralized air conditioning will probably be introduced soon. They have a variety of outdoor sports like volleyball, cricket, football, and badminton. What’s more, they are apparently constructing the largest library in Maharashtra soon. EXTC faculty is supposed to be really good, although maybe a bit strict. Others are just about okay. New professors keep coming and going. Relatively good canteen with more-than-edible food. Misal pav is an all-time favorite. Quite a few of them, actually. There’s a McDonald’s, a Subway, Little World Mall all of which are pretty close by. The huge central park spread over acres of land and built on the lines of New York’s Hyde Prak is also close by (Though it's still under completion)"
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","     College life was good,Don't expect anything good from this college, just be in your crowd and move on, enjoy ur 4 yrs of BE,faculty is average,some are really good and supportive,No new ideas will be shared ,the crowd is mediocre, Tech fest and cultural events are good.Try some other colleges in Navi Mumbai and Mumbai, u will find good exposure there.Kharghar is a good area,lots of new places to visit,you will enjoy the food corners."

"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","Based on previous year reviews, the college was carried out online. The college does have good infrastructure and space for events/festival organizations. But lack of equipment available for Mechanical and Civil students."
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",SCOE college is a good college and faulty behaviour also friendly.
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",The teaching faculty is still good but the management is worst. All local staff non educated always speaking in marathi.
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",Expect placement cell all the sections of college is good for the students and definitely help students to being proffesionals in theire respective field
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",Overall college is average in terms of placement and infrastructure.
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",I would not tell any bad remark but the management is doing a good job. The college gives a lot of exposure by proving guest lecture and even campus placements. As I am placed so my view is you should take admission for different learning.
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",It is fairly good and cooperative and help in being placed though their Network. They also help after completion of course.
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",Socially active our college take part in many activities and also organises many activities and apart from studies they also focus that a student is capable for giving a speech in front of audience Which builds confidence in them.
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ","No, the college is really good in every aspect of one of the best facilities"
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",The teachers and facilities are good in college. Good canteen. Bad things include unavailability of a proper ground to enhance sports. Also some of the crowd is not good.
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",No negative remark but the college should make a ground for itself so that sports will take place regularly because every time the sports are being organised in a ground which is situated in Panvel and many can't travel.
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",Placement is good. But not all branches have good placement percentage. This is the negative remark. Recently our college got 34 MhrD rank. Which is very useful for students to choose the college.
"Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai ",    This college is great. Good facility. Great faculty. Will definitely refer to my juniors. Infrastructure is mind-blowing. Campus crowd is decent. I was afraid at the start but later on I got attached with this college now its like I don't want to leave this college.

Coming to indoor sports there are facilities to play carrom, table tennis and table football (foosball). Our College has a placement committee and also training for placement (TPO) activities. Companies like TCS, Infosys ,Capgemini and many others come for placemrent here. There is Ecell for students who want to become entrepreneurs and encourage them to start their own startups. Many of the college students have created their own startups with guidance from the Ecell committee. There are various committes for all the three fields I.e IT comps and Extc. There is Robocon committee for students interested in robotics and lets them explore their ideas with creating remote-controlled robots on their own with proper guidance. All labs are well maintained and there are PCs with Windows as well as Linux operating system. There are two popular fests every year - IRIS (Cultural fest) held in Feb and MOSAIC (Technical fest) held around September-October. There is a Seminar hall ,an Auditorium ,a huge computer center where students can access the internet. There is NSS like any other college. There are authorized and unauthorized Industrial Visits ,treks held.

Teaching is good overall but some teachers are extremely talented and a few about average. There is projector facility in every classroom. There is a wifi enabled reading room where students can study or work on projects. There is a library with good staff and availability of books, novels, magazines,B.E projects, past papers.There is no hostel as such inside SFIT campus but exactly opposite There is SFIMAR(St Francis Institute of Management and Research) where there is a hostel and I know SFIT students who stay there. SFIT College canteen provides veg as well as non-veg food ,icecreams, soft drinks, snacks,coffee and tea.Also SFIT students go to the Management canteen for variety in choices of food. SFIT has its own stationary and there is one right outside the campus too.For hangouts with friends there is Dominos so near the campus and other places to explore nearby. There is a bus-stop to your left as soon as you leave the college making it much easier to travel for students who come from Bhayander to those from Malad .Also our college is so near from Dahisar as well as Borivali station (more close to Dahisar) just 20 rs by auto.The college is a bit firm on discipline and attendance .So Overall SFIT is a very good pick.It provides students with the best of opportunities,teaching and guidance. I am proud to be an SFITian."
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",     It was a great time. We used to have much fun in group. I miss those days. The faculties were superb and studies were fantastic. Overall a must period in one's life. My favourite subject was Physics. I used to score the highest and my base was very strong on that. Every topic's discussion used to start with me. Teachers were very supportive. Debates were very fruitful for us..
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",     As a student of this college for past one year would like to bring to notice that this is a very good college. The teaching staff is very good and well educated.This college also supports extra circular activities like sports and different fests. The festivals like Iris and mosaic are perfect for hanging out from studies for few days.Sfit has a very COMPUTER engineering branch. College has good connectivity very near from Dahisar station. My message to the students pursuing Engineering considers this college if you want to pursue Computer Engineering as your career.
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",     This college is really strict in terms of attendance and stuff but the quality of the study is nice. The teachers really remember you if you're a defaulter and your life becomes hell in last few weeks of the semester. Teachers don't encourage co-curricular much. Nothing attractive about it except for you've got your squad there to chill. Overall a 3/5
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","     Infrastructure is good, staff members are strict and awesome, the crowd is average .... the facilities are awesome ............ overall great experience, attendance rules are very strict which forces us to go to the college and attend the lectures most of the time."
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",     Infrastructure is good enough. Discipline at its best. HOD are kind and helpful. Teachers don't have much knowledge about the subject but they are average. College is developing and getting better. Many extra activities are also started. You can join various cells and enjoy your college life.
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","     College life isn't wat ideally is, infrastructure is pretty good, faculty is poor except a few good teachers, recreational activities is excellent, environment is best suitable as far as studying is concerned because there is greenery around and der is silence and u can enjoy d beauty of nature along with studying; canteen is worst, but overall it's a good college and nothing wrong with being a part of it;"
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","     The college life is good, not too good not too bad You can bunk a few less, but do take care on the attendance part and wearing the ID card is must though you can fool around without it. Don't come face to face to a teacher without it. And the teaching style, You can relate it to school type which is bad but it in itself has some advantages. College is good in overall view."
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","     Good college life faculty is good helpful crowd of college is very good. The infrastructure of college is not very much pleasing overall it's good. College is very much strict about attendance teaching faculty is very about teaching. St. Francis Institute of Technology (SFIT) has a school-type infrastructure. The campus is huge and well maintained but not eye appealing. It is very clean just like any other Catholic institutes. A gymkhana which comprises Table Tennis, carrom and chess. Facilities for outdoor games like volleyball, basketball, football and badminton are available to the students. Very often you'll see the volleyball court turns into a gully cricket ground. The classrooms are good, but again the same school type benches, blackboards, and windows to look out from (during the lecture). Okay washrooms, very good elevators and peaceful campus complete the infrastructure. Currently, it is undergoing renovation and up gradation of laboratories."
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",     My college is one of the most strict colleges of Mumbai. They make sure you attend lectures and are regular in your studies.There are many extra curricular activities in our college.You can also take part in sports.There is a total of 5 student organisations and there is also e-cell which teaches you entrepreneurship. The infrastructure is just average.There are fests which make sure students do not get bored of studies.Teaching faculty is quite good and they finish the portion on time by keeping extra lectures.
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","St. Francis is definitely the best college I've been to, the fun we had and the rules we've broken, and the assignments, tests, college canteen and its cat."
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",My overall experience is good till now there are many parts where the college can get better . There are many things that i have learned from the college experience till now and it have been great till now .
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","The main reason for me to get to this College is, it's near my place which saves me from too much of Mumbai's hectic traffic. SFIT is a well-known college for its discipline, this college gets the best placement among other colleges in the locality. With an average package of 3 LPA"
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",1. College is very strict regarding studies and attendance 2. Also helps in extra course and help us to study above and beyond syllabus 3. Makes students internship before placements 4. All faculties helps a lot in cultural as well as technical aspects
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",Average: not so good and not so worst our college lagg some quality education and exposure.
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","Professors attitude isn't that amazing. Talking just about the extc faculty. It and CMPN faculty just seems lethargic, which the students feel is an easy going attitude. Atleast the extc profs ensure you are prepared right from start, and won't spring surprises on you towards the end of the semester when you should be studying"
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","Certainly not the top engineering colleges.Management is driven by brothers from Church and are not open towards college betterment in terms of teaching,placements,and infrastructure.Go in the college only if you have no better options and are desperate to do engineering from anywhere."
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","Positive: Great facilities, technical knowledge on a national level, sports and games one national level too. AICTE approval, guaranteed placements and many more things. Negative: Feels like more of a school, lots of restrictions."
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",The most things you will hear for this college is that it's very strict.there is no life for students here.Students are forced to sit for lectures with their attendance criteria. Yaa these things are true but it really is not that much that people speak of. It is a combination of strictness and decipline. Its not that there's no life for students. Students are allowed to play after lectures which most of the college don't allow. Also during events there's lot of entertainment for students. Its not only about enjoying. its about studies plus entertainment. College is college although however it may be you will always remember it when you leave it.
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","Placements are quite good if you see the whole college placement but again for my branch there are no core companies, so people end up in IT companies only."
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",Positive is the attendance and the discipline in the college is the most concern. Negative feedback as on I didn't experience any in my college career. Over-all for a student preferring engineering SFIT is a good option.
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","As I said earlier, The principal and the director have implied school - like rules for students. A student needs to have more than 75% attendance in individual subjects rather than average attendance. They are forcing students to give extra exams."
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",its a better than average rather good college
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",Studying in SFIT is like full of joy and happiness. we gain technical as well as cultural knowledge. the infrastructure is simply WOW. the canteen and food is always upto mark. the teaching and non teaching staffs r loving and caring.
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","The good thing about college is it has better infrastructure, faculty,canteen,play area ,parking and management. The bad thing was the timing of the college hours which was too extreme it almost felt like going to school."
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",I found this College to be strict for attendance and submission. They are really strict for Attendance. If you have Attendance less than 75% (now in each subject) you will be treated like a criminal in the staff room. Parents will be called in the college and imposition will be given to you.
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ","Overall, my experience was great and it was a good college to study in and placements as well were good. The faculty was the best and they used to conduct extra classes for students which was free of cost. The hostel management as well was a bit strict bu"
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",The overall ambience is pleasant.4 years of engineering were pretty hard at the beginning but it went well.Our college has improved majority of its facilities throughout the year.We had a new hall been made for events and shows to take place.
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",The positive side about SFIT is that it's a really good catholic college which maintains discipline in you and gives you an opportunity to display your technical talent and even helps your nuture your hobbies. The only negative remark I've about this college is that the attendance is mandatory for the lectures or the subject teachers at times take severe actions if you are a defaulter in their particular subject.
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",Great as per parents view but students say it sucks because of shitty rules and engineering itself is hectic.
"St Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai ",     The college is having very structured academic plan that helps students to make the best out of facilities available. The faculty are also helpful and the entire syllabus is taught in a well planned manner. The placement has also been improving over the years with dedicated TPO and assistant TPO.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",College has a big campus. It has a great environment to study in. The faculty is very supportive & encouraging. The college is bit too far for students coming from mumbai city. During rainy season there are many travelling issues.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",Every faculty give his best and works towards every student for his excellence and improvement. college lacks bit of infrastructure since engineering campus is bit small as compared to other colleges. Every vacation college conducts free semi ars and workshop.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai","The college crowd here is good. The faculty is decent and some of them are the very best in their respective fields. The college rules are sometimes too strict and questionable. Overall, it is a decent college and I have had a positive experience overall"
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",The college has adequate infrastructural facilities for effective learning. More stress has to be laid on practical learning. Industry diplomats should be made to visit the campus and hold seminars to familiarize students with the existing industry and market conditions. Dedicated professors and a friendly cosmopolitan mix of students with a number of extracurricular activities and events to participate in made my college experience enjoyable. The college has an efficient training and placement cell that brings in good companies but care should be taken to see that all students other than IT department are placed. Professors were dedicated but more stress and efforts should be put in providing good practical knowledge to the students and see that they are molded according to industry requirements. The college is affordable to all students belonging to the middle-class background and the fees are not exorbitant but fair in comparison to the quality of education provided.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai","College is beautiful! Campus is good, a crowd is awesome, awesome friends, very lively, great teachers, always ready to help. A lot of events all round the year. Students councils and other councils are great (as I too was a part of it). Placements are good. Overall experience is fantastic."
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",It has really been great 4 years with all mixed emotions right from 1st day until the last day.Great staff and very good student crowd have what made SIES happening and this student-teacher culture was always appreciated from various delegates on their visits to SIES! Unity among the students be it for right or wrong reasons has always been on top! The most beautiful thing we Gstian's cherish is the beautiful temple inside the campus! Sies has always been a treasure for me and I will cherish all memorable moments throughout my life
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",The faculties are good and sound technically.Have to improvise the infrastructure of the college.Good environment to study.library and other facilities are also good Affordable fees and worth studying. Apart from studies I developed my interpersonal skills and technical skills by participating in several events like IMPRESSION and cultural programs Organized by my college I really feel proud to say that I am a student of SIES GST.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai","High fees ,moderate infrastructure, good crowd. No ground no hostel. Laboratory infrastructure is moderate Overall just fine.Located in Navi Mumbai. Fests are organized nicely . 10 mins walkable distance from the neural station. I have no descriptive words left to complete your 250 characters. Please remove this kind of silly validations."
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",Good college with an awesome crowd and good placements. The faculty is ok.Infrastructure is good with a good library and practical labs.The only problem is strictness related to mobile usage and other things.Placement facility is good. It's one of the few colleges which provides a degree in Printing and packaging technology.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",Placements of the college are pretty decent . Had fun working with college student council by hosting various events. Principal sometimes opposed the cultural events and used to tell a student to focus more on studies which created problem while working for student council. Unnecessary strict restrictions on mobile usage in college campus were so m much frustrating.Learned a lot during the college life.Overall experience was pretty good
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",The college is definitely decent as far as infrastructure is concerned when compared with other colleges affiliated to Mumbai university. There is a requirement for a P.A. system to ensure that important information can be passed spontaneously. Also the instruments for various departments must be functional and students must not feel the lack of basic requirements. On the placement front a student body should be present and students must also actively participate in bringing companies for recruitment. It should be mandatory to have a PhD professor in each department. There must be diversity amongst the faculty to guide students in an industrial aspect and research aspect.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai","Good infrastructure is a key factor for any educational institutions, SIES is one of it. Faculty members and their industrial experience help students to gain maximum knowledge. A good library with optimum books and e-media, a good place to hunt for knowledge. Modern laboratories peruse students to gain maximum practical experience. Also, extracurricular activities are the best part, Tatwa Moksha Laksh is one of the well-known festivals in Navi Mumbai. Overall SIES is a good place to pursue the career."
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai","The environment is good , college is very strict in case of attendance , mobile phones are not allowed which is not tolerable. Infrastructure is good but the campus is not upto the level. There was no hostel so only localides can attend it. Faculty was not good. There was no playground."
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai","The most primary aspect by which we can judge any college is academics. Now, the teachers are friendly and approachable in nature,however,the faculty is very particular about its attendance and about the discipline the students maintain. Like any other college, SIES has its technical(cognition) and cultural(TML) festivals. Many events are brought up in these festivals and the efforts put in do not lack in any aspect. Nevertheless, I have seen two points that hamper the festival. The first one being the approach taken by event heads. Their persuasion lacks motivation and seems more like a compulsion. The second one, the way the event head organizes the events. According to me, the time bracket of many events clashes with each other. The last point, the infrastructure of my college. It is not as flashy as the other colleges that are compared with SIES, but they try to make most of it. In a nutshell, its worth giving a shot. Even though the college has its own share of flaws, if you have the will to make the most out of the college, SIES is sure to help out."

"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",It is a very nice college. Teachers are very cooperative and helpful. A lot of events are being held for the benefit of students. It has a very good college infrastructure. A very good positive aura is found in each and every corner of the college. The college is very good in sports activities. The college has a famous 33 feet tall hanuman statue and temple. Each and every faculty teaching has a good experience and sound knowledge in their field. This is the only college offering two in one i.e B.E. Printing and Packaging Technology in the Asian continent.

Placement is good. overall college life is good. Faulty is willing to help.. one of the good college in navi Mumbai. A mix of crowd (majority is South Indian, but doesn’t matter). You’ll find both kinds of people here fun-loving and books-crazy. A very energetic crowd makes the college environment vibrant and active."
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",Decent college but very strict with attendance. Lush green campus with excellent infrastructure. The campus has excellent facility for sports with a good gym. SIES is a very old and reputed brand in Mumbai and well known in Navi Mumbai as well. This college will help in overall student development.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",The management is not that great. Many rules and stuff which make it seem like a college. Other than that the college is a really great place to grow as a person even if you dont learn anything. Students all come together to help other students to develop in more ways then just studies. The seniors and the alumni are the best things about the college. And the activities
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",For some lectures you will have a rotating class due to lack of space.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",Our college is definitely one of the best college in not only in Navi Mumbai but in Maharashtra. Seniors helps juniors in every aspect of their college life. Teachers guides the students in right direction. There are many more opportunities provided by college to students to show their skills in academics as well as extracurricular activities.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",Na Overall good exposure to technical world. Also good contacts to get students into good internship offers. Placement team is also very good with good corporate contacts.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai","Among all of the colleges in which I was able to take admission, I heard from my seniors that SIES had good campus and placements. I had heard that SIES had a good faculty and teachers are friendly and they help students whenever they need them. SIES fests are too popular so it lead me to it."
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",I got admission on thr basis of my JEE Mains marks. I had scored 110. I was interested in Computer Science hence I took the course. I opted for this college because it was one of the best options available close to where I live be because I hate travelling everyday.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",The college is excellent for students who wants to improve their self in studies and extracurricular activities.this is the wonderful place where you can learn the difficult concepts of engineering with indulging in extracurricular activities like NSS and student council activities.also there are 6 student chapters and students can take their membership based in their interest.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai","Ground is very essential for a college and this is the only thing we are lacking behind in.The entire premises of the college is very clean and tidy also the toilets are very clean.U can find ro purified water at every floor of the building and the canteen food is also healthy.If u live in a hostel, u can blindly rely on the canteen food"
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai","Their sincerity towards teaching, campus and placements attracted me towards the college. Also, I preferred joining a computer science program above any other and I was desperate to get a college of my major as soon as possible. So getting into this college was mainly because it offered me my desired course with decent placement offers for the future."
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai","This was the only college that had this course, it was close to my house and it was a reputed institution within Mumbai University. Moreover SIES had a plethora of options when it came to extra curricular activities."
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",no hostel facility No ground Labs are very good Lab faculty can be better Teachers are very good and helpful Seniors are also very helpful Events organized are also good There is no transportation facilities
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",My College is way better in everything i dont have any problem with my College. Each and everything is good. i am soo lucky to be in this College. My College even has scooty/bike parking thats the best benefit.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",It is overall a good choice for students scoring around 100-120marks in mhcet. It will be surely a great platform to enjoy the four years as well as study.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",Decent college overall and will have your beautiful memories of your life here.Decent college overall and will have your beautiful memories of your life here.Decent college overall and will have your beautiful memories of your life here.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai",Way too Strict college the only college in mumbai charging 5000 bucks as as a fine and confiscating cell phones if found to be used within college campus but overall its always fun to break all the rules and keep the teachers back for a chase.
"SIES Graduate School of Technology, Navi Mumbai","The college has decent faculties and has a really good infrastructure , no playground or such ammenities.However it is a good place to be at and there is an opportunity to interact with many people because of the small batch size. A tradeoff is with the term works and grade as it is not very just at the college but it has improved. But if you are for awesome campus life SIES is not the place to be.The placement is improving TCS Igate and LNT being the primary recruiters.The fests are good but not happening as most other colleges in Mumbai. The fees is higher than the average fees in Mumbai colleges."
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","Horrible experience. Zero placement along with below average teaching faculty and last but not least canteen food needs to get change. College infrastructure was good enough but rules in this was terrible. If someone caught with a cellphone, he/she was supposed to pay Rs 5,000."
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","There are no nearby hangouts. Instead students prefer to play football or cricket in the college ground. If you love indoor sports, there’s a gymkhana where you can amuse yourself by playing pool, carom & chess. Goga Pure Veg is only other option than canteen to eat outside college."
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","Needs to think more about the quality of education rather than quantitative. Needs better infrastructure in classes than construction of turf If you want to enjoy college life it's a best place Support needs to be given to students which work in college events , which for now is not given help in academics is a thing on which college should focus"
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","College is very good,but overall ambiance is not that much nice. Nowadays treating every student like they are in school. No freedom to leave college once you enter, the gates get shut aftr 10am and open after 3. Placements are good, companies come to visit are very nice. You can learn many things here But canteen is average, need to develop it more and to provide quality food with more menu's."
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","Great infrastructure to accommodate students. Helping seniors, no ragging whatsoever. Great placement cell provides amazing opportunities, better than most suburban colleges. Some great initiatives and clubs to join in and make a difference. College fest is also a highlight of this institution. Great crowd to socialize. Although some aspects can be improved but despite of all that a great institution"
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","Good infrastructure, Sufficient placement, Knowledgeable staff, Excellent cultural festival, Excellent technical festival, friendly environment, Good scope to develop n excel in our field of choice, Good learning facility, Helping seniors & staffs, Healthy competition between students, Motivating students by felicitating them by giving them certis n trophies so that can do better next time, Excellent sports festival, Encouraging students to participate in sports, Overall development of the students."
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai",This college teaches you not not only about the course but also about various aspects of engineering...right from providing support to providing opportunities..a supportive and skilled staff and the crowd is good..would definitely recommend this college to all
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","One of the best Private institution in Mumbai for Engineering studies. Good management and Support. In my 4 years of education, I have found so many learning opportunities till date. The course structure is very good. Also, the status of placement is good. Especially they are providing lot of placement trainings and conducting lot of aptitude exams to nourish each students skill. My experience in this college is really good. Also, there are many academic programs held in college like international conference, various kinds of exhibitions etc. All of the teaching and non teaching staff are very helpful. Extracurricular programs like blood donation camp, social work etc happen in college. In all, I would recommend the future aspirants to join this college as it will lead to their better future."
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai",Best bits of this college lies within the ample play space and recreational amenities. Level of education varies a lot . Faculty is on one hand very skilled in your first year but somewhat deteriorates further. Very nice crowd is not expected inspite of the fact that the college is well within suburban area.overall great experience.
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai",College infrastructure is good. They keep renovating all the time. So the canteen has changed thrice in 4years. College staff is too helpful in times of need. They have a playground basketball court and a lawn. All activities are organized by students and it's a good experience organizing those events to build your leadership and teamwork qualities..overall experience is good in this college.
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","The college has 2 adjacent building with the view of Eastern express highway on the front side, while a view of the ground of college on the rear complex. The Placement cell should work more and get enough placements to pull more crowd. Overall a good experience studying, but you'll enjoy roaming around more with the friends you make there. I had done electronics engineering and the faculty was also good and knowledgeable."
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","     Excellent Placement Opportunities, excellent teaching Staff, huge campus, good reviews, excellent crowd, best play grounds, number of turfs( three), pool campus interviews, multiple awards received by the college for top college in mumbai through various prestigious organisations, Excellent batch of seniors"
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai",     Actually I didn't chose the college the MHT-CET Score I got chose the college but it turned out be a very good college if you ignore 2 or 3 useless faculties. The campus is very nice. And the big advantage of getting into this college is that there is no blacklist for attendance less than 75 %. The placement and training department is the best part of the college it does everything for students.
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","     Great, college has excellent campus college has 4 acres of sport ground it includes three turf one basketball court Kabaddi court and one volleyball court every your our college conducts three technical events tantra Oscillation"
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","     I got admission by DTE after I shortlisted. And it near to my house and the branch is available for me. College infrastructure is good and location is convenient to reach by bus, auto, texi or local train also."
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai",     There is a good mix of students from different parts of the country.

"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","     Since the last three years, I'm having the best educational experience of my life. Our college provides the best infrastructure and college campus. The canteen at our college is also very good. Hygiene is well maintained and the best quality food is provided in the college. The college management always thinks in the best interest of the students. The college library has a very vast collection of reference books required for academics. Internet facility is provided in the library for the students. The labs of our college are well maintained and have all the apparatus in good condition. Extracurricular activities are given the same importance as academics. The cultural fests give the students a platform to showcase their talents in front of the college. Technology day and engineering are celebrated in the college with great excitement. Sports are also given equal importance. There are different committees like the student council, Nss, Tpo, eco-club, WDC etc work for the betterment of students and helps the students to grow their knowledge in the respective fields"
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai",       College overall is good but needs to improve a lot in the terms of its name since this college is struck in a controversy on unofficial land taken to build the college and there is no safety of fire till few years. But now the principal is working on this to develp the college and seeking all sorts of permission.
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","     Negative remarks Fee Structure is average but facilities are very less as compared to fee Structure. Fees should be reduced looking at the infrastructure and facilities that are provided Faculty of the college should be more friendly. Should concentrate more on practical knowledge to students rather than taking useless submissions. Should be polite , friendly and should respect students as even once they were students"
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","     No negative remarks. My college is the best in the city. Excellent infrastructure, faculties. Facilities, placements, events. It's been taken care that we are not falling short of anything. I hope my college continues to be the same"
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","      College is good you will have a typical college life of engineering assignments, practicals are sometimes too much to do but its part of curriculum. only negative remark is crowd should have been better at my times also there no nearby hang out place."
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai",     Our college is very good in mumbai region. having only 4 courses offered in our college the college faculty and management is well accountable. Our college is very strict about attendance in college.
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai",      Food quality in the canteen should improve. And also there is no playground in our college. College does not have proper gym room .
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai",     There must be good sports teacher for us so please provide and invite every student for sports also not only for coding contests
"Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Mumbai","It is one of the prominent college in Mumbai. Situated in the heart of Mumbai is located at Sion-Chunabhatti. It is spread over 2 acres of land with decent infrastructure and play area. It has a football ground of its own. The college faculty is well knowledgeable and helpful. It has given me friends for life and they are not just friends to hang around but highly knowledgeable and have a better understanding of future perspective. Regarding the placement, it invites decent companies ranging from TCS , Capgemini, to the recent banking company Ariston Capital. Overall the college is nice and a good option for those seeking admission in the engineering field in Mumbai."
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai",College is overall good . But placement in this college is worst. Teachers are cooperative most of the time. The new canteen is worst. Not at all good. Industrial visit is not good. Must we had one in our college life . No hostel for boys and girls. So outside mumbai students have to search hostel and paying guest of they are ad admitted in this college.
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","The infrastructure is good. The faculty is very good and supportive. You can feel free to go to them at any time if you are stuck somewhere. About 20% of teachers hold a Ph.D. and some are pursuing. You'll have ample opportunities for co-curricular and extracurriculars too. There is no hostel facility available but you can contact the admin. Office and they'll help you. The canteen is the best part, though ;) All in all. A modest place to be in."
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","Best engineering college with excellent placements and faculty members. Accredited engineering college by Government of India, Maharashtra and Mumbai University. Best engineering faculty under Mumbai University. It has a good location for peaceful study and creating bright engineers. It is superior in any adverse situations and helpful in creating excellent careers. Undoubtedly top engineering college in Mumbai. Creating good future and talented engineers."
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","Manjara Charitable Trust's Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology (RGIT) is located near 7 bungalows, Versova. The nearest railway station is Andheri. RGIT's glass building which looks stunning at the first glance has a balcony/small terrace on every floor. Faculty at RGIT, in general, is nice. The Boys to girls ratio is the same like any other engineering college. Students from the Western and Northern suburbs and South Mumbai are mostly seen in this college. Owing to it RGITs upmarket location, the college has some fantastic hangouts.Versova beach and 'Versova rocks' followed by Yari road are all very close to the college."
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","According to me, the college looks good from the outside but to beware all this is from the outside. Professors are rude, unruly and try to make students feel less and beneath themselves. The infrastructure is poor, canteen is small and cannot cope with the demand of students."
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","Good college with great infrastructure has a good name in sports as well, but you have to pay the expenses of sports yourself (travel, etc). As any other college, some teachers are good and some are okay. Can't say anything about placements as I am yet to complete my course."
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","The crowd is great, the faculty is average, college timing is good, location is average, teachers are helpful but are strict, the canteen is average.

"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","Infrastructure is the fantastic view from college is awesome because of Versova beach. Not so strict about attendance and all placement is average, canteen is nice, labs are ok, feasts are awesome, faculty is average, surrounding is nice, metro station is nearby, hangout places are awesome, overall a decent college"
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","The college is located in Andheri (W) and affiliated to University of Mumbai. My overall experience was great. Good quality of crowd, good infrastructure and great location. Faculty is easy going, not going harsh over deadlines and all. Need to study on your own mostly as most faculty is young and bit inexperienced. Lots of activities like college fests. Good placement companies, mostly IT. Has more departments than usual like mechanical, MCA etc."
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","Sea facing college balconies, Vibrant festival culture, Above average faculty, Location of college (PVR , Lokhandwala market, Juhu Beach, Irla market are all close by and this is excluding many other awesome restaurants nearby).

"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","To start with,one thing comes first,you will not find any other college with the better location then this.college is located near beach.canteen is really awesome,food is ok but to sit there with chilling breeze with friends is different thing.faculty is really strict,and one thing here in this college faculty is not partial,they will not hesitate to give in internal kt if your performance is not good.also there is no ground for college and hostel facility is also not present."
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","A good place to be at ,cool atmosphere ,decent canteen, decent staff, great location , okay type infrastructure good place to be at with cool atmosphere"
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai",Course curriculum is pretty good regarding comp. engineering. Exam structure is usually divided into 8 semesters in which in each semester you will need to study and take care orelse you would end up with a KT instead. Teaching is too good and upto mark.
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","Our college is one of the best engineering college in Mumbai, but quality of education is not upto the level upto which it should be infact all private engineering colleges in India have same condition. Infrastructure is well developed."
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","It is average when compared to all the engineering colleges in Mumbai. Yearly fees are around 1.1L. It is feasible for many, but because of Freeships and Scholarships by Government of Maharashtra, people get tuition fee waiver making the course feasible for all."
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","All basic facilities are available in college. College infrastructure is overall good. Spacious classrooms with projectors wherever necessary, labs, xerox & stationary centre ,Wi-Fi in library is also available. Canteen provides good food."

"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","The college does have all the basic amenities, which is satisfying the infrastructure is good ,however no campus. The college does have a well maintained library with over 2000 books , journals and papers."
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai",Fee Structure And Facilities Fee structure is less for caste students as it is the case in all other colleges. It's not too expensive but not until the Mark. Its 99k per year for bachelors in any field.
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai",Labs are well maintained. Facilities are up to mark as needed. Most importantly internet access should be provided at least on lab computers. The only thing I love about this college is its scenic view visible from the college windows.
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","As of the teaching most of the teachers are excellent in their respective domains , the curriculum is slightly outdated and needs further enhancement for further employability and further placements ."

"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","The course curriculum is well designed by the experienced faculties teaching Computer Engineering under Mumbai University. Recently, their has been changes in the curriculum so as to meet industrial needs. There are 2 unit tests of 20 marks each carried out, one is after 30-40% syllabus gets covered, the next is during term end. Final semester exams of 80 marks take place after practical and oral exams. Faculty is good."
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai",Overall my 2 years experience is good. Teachers are helpful too. They used to clear my doubts.So many extra curricular activities happens in college almost on daily basis. Most importantly no ragging is there in college. All seniors are also so supportive

Also, the proper security guard is there for Id check-in in college In the college, a faculty is helpful for students to their problem. Labs are well maitained. Proper facilities are provided."
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","Quality of placement is average. IT companies like Infosys came during campus placement. IT and Comps students are getting placed well as compared to other departments. Placement Cell is there in the college which provides information about Job apportunities , internships to all students."
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai",Like any other mu college you may find some good and bad teachers.....different people may have different opinions about the professor....acc to me most of the staff is quite good and also friendly with the students
"MCTs Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai","Rajiv Gandhi institute of technology, Mumbai is located at versova, Andheri. The college offers five streams to choose from, mechanical, Instrumentation, EXTC, IT and comps. The college faculty does not live up to its expectations. Overall, its a decent college but definitely not one to opt for in the first round."
"Fr C Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ",Rajiv Gandhi institute of technology The college is situated at very good place. Infrastructure is good. There is balcony at every floor so that u can spend ur time there. Companies like l&t visit to the campus for placement. Talking of canteen that's next iitb only in Mumbai region.
"Fr C Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ",    Don't enter the central jail. This college is horrible to the core. Attendance is compulsory for every event you can imagine. The students are horrible too . All are from Koparkhairane gaon and vashi gaon. All they care is about marks. No technical projects. No thinking outside the box. This four years are of utmost importance . You cannot you just should not waste it in this jail. Peace Bezos.
"Fr C Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ","    One of the most strict college.Choosing this college is one of the biggest mistake of my life.I assumed strict meant good quality of teaching, but it's not so. Most of the facilities mentioned in the brouhchre are fake, like access to the turf(football ground) , swimming pool etc. Both the facilities i mentioned are given on rent in commercial basis. Students have to pay for practicing on ground. The canteen is no more than a gowndown. The infrastructure is very poor, the environment is dull. Going into details the college college doesn't allow (not promote) creative thinking. Attendance is not given to the people who represent college in different competition like Robocon. In the First year of the college you will have to face the warth of Humanities department where you will face infinite loop of retest and never ending assignments. The worst of all departments is the electrical department,here teacher's are only looking for opportunities to trouble students. If you are absent for one day you have to complete the day's work and give Viva on it,then and then only you will be allowed to sit in the class. Summing up I won't recommend to you to take this college if you want to live a happy and mentally healthy life."
"Fr C Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ",     College experience is okay. Faculty members are well educated. One of the A grade college in NAVI MUMBAI. Come here only if you will be on time and be prepared for tests every week. Indian education gives very less exposure to industries but we go for industrial visits every semester and the faculty members with experience share them when topic comes up. Overall its a good college and quite strict.
"Fr C Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ",      College is good in respect of studies and faculties are concern. The new building is on the verge of completion which might see really good facilities and equipment for the incoming students in future. The only thing I am hate this clg is its No time for extra curricular activities....that can be done only after 4.30 which really is bad. Fest is like nothing which is also made compulsory to realise that u r in jail.   
"Fr C Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ","      I learned alot more than I expected. Faculty is too friendly.Campus crowd is inspirational, healthy n supportive.Teaching experience was very good n practicals was quite interesting but not helping too much.Workshop experience helps alot.Technical event's by ARC are too good.College should support students for national international level competitions by funding sponsorships.   "
"Fr C Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ","      Infrastructure is no so good but comfortable. Points for college improvement are: 1.More corporate world exposure is necessary for students. 2. Because of average quality of examinations students lack basic concepts so companies won't be much interested in our college students. Placement has been declining in the recent years   "
"Fr C Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ","      The best thing about this college is the Professors and the placement. Professors do take care that the portion is completed on time and are generally very strict about the performance of the students. This college is surely not for students who join Engineering ""just to have fun"". However, you might come across some ridiculous rules in this college like attending the college fest is compulsory for all students.   "
"Fr C Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ","      Trying to get your ward an admission in this collegePlease think THRICE before doing so!Most of the parents try to collect information about such infrastructures via the college website or some 3rd person whose some long lost relative have studied there...1. Being an 'AGNELITE', here's my review for this college based on my 4yr experience I had there..2. 1st yr, sem1, 2nd week of the college: my roommate gets accused of copy case, which actually was a washed out mcD receipt.. they scolded him to the level that the guy develops fits in the practicals henceforth leaving the college.3. You would've never thought how much writing work you have to do each sem just to score 5 marks for the termwork.4. 87â„… Attendance & your parents get a call that your child have low attendance & sholud compulsory attend the PTIs.. no matter how far they stay else no attendance until they make contact with resp. teacher.5. Canteen rates just went ahead of what they actually taste.. you can actually see a lot of hostelites (who already paid for the mess) sharing meals with local students or ordering separately. Hostelites can have a decent meal only during breakfast on tuesdays & sundays.6. People seeking college hostel for their stay: no wifi till 5PM even if you have final year project on off-days. Till last year, there were 2 visitors room in boy's hostel, which are now given to the students. So parents visiting their ward 'must have a relative' staying nearby or should try to get a hotel room.7. College faculty is good in their own ways, but don't even think to mess with anyone.. you can't guess what will be coming back to you in return! Some teachers actually worth a lot more even if they are strict, while others won't even bother.8. COLLEGE FESTS: literally EVERYTHING is COMPULSORY here, even the inter-college fest (only for saying out loud) 'ETAMAX'. you have to pay a huge debt to participate in different events for each day else a fine of â‚¹4500 to be paid to the college for not attending the fest (seriously think about it!)9. Coming back to hostel: PLEASE LOCK YOUR DOORS & CUPBOARDS else you'd regret sulking in the vain of loosing your belongings.10. College introduced minority quota in yr 2012 & the college lost its ranking since then.. you got to have more then good scores to enter this college (think again!)11. The college teaches you many things in its own way that you'll experience yourself in future but my overall rating would be 4.5/10 for this college.   "
"Fr C Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ","      When I first entered in this college ,I was really excited about my new journey in life.As I entered teacher gave me the burden of huge syllablus of engineering and schedule of each and every test in the term year.Literally,I had brought only one book. But each and every teacher told us to complete the notes.In this college faculties tried to indulge fear of engineering syllabus in you.Canteen is like that you are in workshops place.. Playground is not available for you as you have to attend each and every lecture. For using playground you have to pay for it.(Disgusting).Other than that students really understands each others pain and I made very good friends for my life.In short its just like a jail in which the faculties are jailers.. But this college teach you how to survive in corporate industry and how to handle stress   "
"Fr C Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ","      Sure its a jail for few students. But if your motive is to learn and excel in your academics, then its a heaven. The Best faculty you can expect. This college will imbibe you with discipline, punctuality, determination. Good placement opportunity. I loved my experience in this college.   "
"Fr C Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ","      The college infrastructure was all right but the faculty needs to be selected with more precision for quality . The placement scenario was good but proper preparation and guidance should be given . Syllabus is a different thing but real industrial exposure should be given as in the end theory only doesn't come to help .The practical approach should be built .People should be helped to build their career early on like suggest students for certifications .. courses etc .As a college environment, it was good .   "
"Fr C Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai ","      I'll mostly be talking about the First Year experience as that is going to be the hardest time there. I'm sure most of you have heard about how strict this college is, and I assure you they are completely correct.Let's start with the ""Humanities Department""- This is the department you will be under in your first year. This comprises of Basic Sciences (PCM). I am trying my best to not be prejudiced but they are probably the most hated department in the college and rightly so!Let me elaborate-A few years back the college became a ""minority"" institution and the ""quality"" of students took a dive. So to maintain their reputation as a good college they will use anything they legally can to convert you into a law abiding student.If you have a problem with authority, the 4 years you spend here will be traumatic. The ironically named Humanities department is the most stubborn and dedicated department you will ever come across, they do not take their job lightly.I once failed a prelim exam and the teacher sat with me and other failures till 7:30 in the night !!!It did end up helping me but I digress.To increase the aforementioned quality"" of students they have used certain tactics some of them end up being useful and some of them don't but something they all have in common is that they are all painful.1- There are weekly tests called tutorials which if you fail they will give you Impositions(Write the whole damn thing five times, etc). I once had to write a Physics paper 15 times!! This is a completely useless tactic as nothing I write is by goodwill and by the time of the End-Sem exams I forget all of it. It does nothing but adds to the frustration of seeing your friends sleep and waste time where you are in class.2-Remedials- This is quite possibly the only college with prelim exams and this is the week before the actual prelim exams where everyone has to come to college and revise. Never before has my time been wasted is such an orderly and disciplined manner. This is also one of those times where you will be whining about your college life.3-Prelims- This, however, was not such a bad idea and has helped many to prepare better for the Semester exams.4-Re-Prelims- Yes, this college has Re-Prelims.I will give you a moment to let that sink in.!This is what you have to do if you fail Preliminary exams. I failed one, and the teacher sat with me till 7:30 in the night! I have never seen such dedication in a teacher before (I am not claiming this to be a good thing). But my feeling is mixed towards this one because after that day I opened the books only before the exam day and I still passed with flying colors.!5-Attendance- This college has probably the most strict college in terms of attendance. In 12th, I had an attendance % of about 25-35% but after coming here it is now 85-90%. It has been really difficult to adapt to this college's rules.I find this to be not very productive. There are times where I just wanna get some rest and anything taught will not be affecting me in any way,  but I can't, and I find that counter-productive and quite frankly irritating.6-College Fests-This is absolutely ridiculous.You have to pay a fine of Rs.500 per day for every day of fest you don't attend. I thought they were using it as a scare tactic, I was wrong! Their reasoning is that nobody comes if they don't keep the fine.  We attend more lectures than any other college, we do more work than the students of any other college, I'm sorry if we don't want to attend the 'barely average' fests. I'd rather rest! Do you want us to attend lectures or have good fest?Make up your mind!There is something fundamentally and philosophically wrong with this college.The Father of our Nation once said, ""Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes."" This place doesn't give you the freedom to make mistakes.Here the teachers have absolute power.The students are powerless. This is psychologically degrading and just..sad! BUT....this college also has one of the highest pass percentages in the first year(75-85%!).That's all I have to say about the first year experience.I won't be going into too much detail about other things as they can be found anywhere on the web but still...as a formality-1-Canteen-7.5/10 Good enough, Cheap enough2-Hostel-Wouldnot know3-Infrastructure-7/10 Okay. I guess4-Faculty-10/10-I hate them but they do a good job5-People-Christian/Mallus and  generally above average studentsIn conclusion-This is more or less a school. Fear is the name of the game. There are always some who try to rebel, but the faculty will slowly tire them till they forget what they were doing in the first place. College Life is nonexistent. You will regret the decision to come to this college even though it has some benefits. In the end, it tries to imprison the youthful spirit of college kids and changes you permanently for better or for worse. You can only hope it doesn't do the latter.When you first set foot in here you will find it depressing and for lack of a better word, it is, but you must always keep in mind that at least some of it is helping you ( Sounds grim? I agree).P.S- If I don't get a 10 Lakh package for all the s**t I have put up with, I will personally burn the college down :D)   "

"Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai","Infrastructure is good. Placement for my degree isn't that good. Faculties are 75% good. Other curricular activities are many to develops extra skills in students. Crowd is good. Hostels are also convenient. Library facilities are also excellent. I would recommend this college for the best degree like chem eng and technology of polymer. Placement for Chem engineering and polymer tech are good, not for other courses."
"Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai",The experience was great.Teaching was good.Need to focus on placement. Student interaction and interview career guidance are some areas where ICT doesn't hold good.the positive side is renowned professors whose recommendation would get you admit in any reputed foreign University. Half of the students opt to study abroad after completion of graduation programme.
"Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai","Placements could be better with the participation of faculty.Although technical placements are relatively easy to snag, non-technical jobs like consulting are not encouraged as a part of the college culture. Excellent for further studies in the field of interest, research projects and internships are encouraged throughout the course of the course and notable colleges abroad are aware of the college and the courses offered. The campus is beautiful. College fests are small, contained and personal. Each department works in a very different manner; some are better than others. Hostel lacks space and is extremely crammed."
"Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai","4 Years I spent in ICT were the most happening, beautiful years of my life. It has changed my whole life. College is established in 1933 what more to say about its legacy. The college has got the very beautiful campus in the heart of Mumbai with proximity to Dadar station. Alumni base of the college is so strong that it might surpass big Institutions in India. 16-acre campus fulfils all the requirements and there are no infrastructural constraints. Life there is so happening and peer group is very active which motivates you to do more with superior quality. Placements are quite decent but most of the students to pursue higher education from reputed institutes than just joining 9-5 job. Professors are the best asset of ICT, especially Pharmacy department professors are excellent."
"Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai",The college faculty is very experienced. The college gives a chance to learn a lot of things apart from studies. The culture and the spirit of all the festivities are very high. The mess food is also good. The campus is not that good but still in small space provides a lot of opportunities. Learn and grab the opportunities and look forward to the bright future.
"Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai","ICT has a Research driven culture. Students are found mostly in their aprons across the state of the art laboratories round the year.

India needs quality driven education culture like this 83 old institute."
"Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai","INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY, MUMBAI, (ICT) is the best college, in every aspect. All the faculty here is student oriented, they are always available for students. All faculty members are much educated (none has a degree less than Phd). Atmosphere and surrounding of the college is pleasant, silent. Infrastructure is adorable. College life is superb here with much supporting seniors and coordinating juniors. Along with academics, here you can excel in extra curricular activities too. Mantra, Vortex and Sports Saga are cultural, technical and sports event respectively which are India's biggest festivals. You enjoy participating and managing these events. Hostel life is too good. You have many industrial visits which give you extra knowledge and experience about the topic. In short, ICT gives all-round development for an individual to become future entrepreneurs and professionals."
"Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai",ICT has a huge campus and it is vast and beautiful. The college building is slightly old but is well maintained. No shortage of space with an in-campus football field and a basketball court to name a few facilities. Hostel facilities are available. There are 5 hostel buildings which cater to the students' need of accommodation.The teachers are very helpful but expect the student to study every subject in complete detail and set papers which tests an individuals' intelligence and not just rote learning skills.
"Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai","     This college is perhaps the best for chemical engineering in the world but have seen many of my friends have left the chemical engineer here and instead took admission in energy resources at IIT Powai instead! However I've also heard that Mukesh Ambani left IIT Powai and joined here in the third year. However good the college may be, the choice differs from one to another. I have observed a general trend of getting good college over good branch and according to my knowledge chemical is considered to be a core branch."
"Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai","    The college is a host to some of the most brightest,unique and innovative students as well as faculty. The labs are highly equipped with quality machinery that one can possibly need for research. The cherry on the cake is that it is well known throughout the world as one of the finest institutes in chemical engineering technology. The students generated are of high potential and caliber to innovate and invent. There are some faults that almost every institute has like some of the teachers don't take required amount of lectures, or non support of teachers for some student activities etc. The hostel facilities are great and everything that a hosteler needs is provided on time. The staff is quite helping and dedicated. Academics, sports or culture everything is done with high spirits and great pomp. This institute leaves a mark anywhere it goes.Overall this institute is a hub to the young potential candidates of the country's youth who have ""Chemical dreams""!"

"Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai","The students have a very huge potential. However, lack of resources and parochial outlook towards technical education has depleted the quality of engineers produced from the college. The college is below par for a very active student. Hence I would recommend future students to try other options before choosing this college. I would specially like to mention people coming from metropolitan cities. Kindly, avoid taking admission in this college as it will surely hamper your outlook and would not challenge you at all. Instead it would frustrate you over its conventional way of functioning."
